Back in 1954, after the Senate (including half of his fellow Republicans) censured Joe McCarthy, the pathogens of his conspiracy madness remained, and a generation ago began seriously propagating and infecting the mainstream, weakening its immunities to a demagogue like Donald Trump. Looking back at that Republican history, it’s clear that the party’s reality-based Establishment was in charge from the 1960s through the ’80s, exploiting but marginalizing its useful idiots. It wasn’t until the age of right-wing talk radio and Fox News and Breitbart that the Establishment lost control, as crackpot habits of mind achieved dominance. Indeed, more and more of the reckless, hysterical conspiracist language of Trump’s frenzied defenders in the mainstream resembles that of the lunatic, fringe right from a half-century ago.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nRead more from 'How the GOP Went Crazy' by Kurt Andersen on Slate.com.

But dwell on it for a moment, and imagine what this would actually look like in practice. Under Trump’s proposal, any Cabinet secretary could decide that, say, a law enforcement official investigating the president had “undermined the public trust” or “failed the American people”—and fire him on the spot. In other words, Trump is calling for an end to any semblance of independence for the IRS, the FBI, the Department of Justice, or any other federal agency.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nRead more from Yascha Mounk on the State of The Union on Slate.com.

Ferguson that racial segregation is constitutionally permissible.\n1960s: Congress finally passes laws ending segregation and guaranteeing black Americans the right to vote.\nIn short, the first 350 years or so of U.S. history involved white Americans insisting that black Americans were members of an inferior racial group and setting up systems of employment, housing, education, and law enforcement that reflected that belief.

In fact, much of it has to do with what we leave behind. It’s a manmade phenomenon so massive that Earth scientists suggest it’s creating a distinct geological layer upon the Earth made up of technofossils. According to a conservative geological estimate from a team of international researchers led by the University of Leicester, all this stuff weighs 30 trillion tons. That’s 110 pounds—the weight of a semi-truck’s tire—for every square meter of the earth’s surface. The group also calculated that the sheer diversity of the types of technofossils we as a species have made—it already exceeds the number of biotic species living on Earth now, and may even “exceed the total biological diversity through Earth’s history.” Read more from @starrevartan on what we can do to reduce waste and make the technosphere smarter on Slate. \nAbove, an 11-year-old girl collects what can be used as food for pigs at a landfill dumpsite outside Siem Reap in Cambodia on March 19, 2015.

The Falcon 9 first stage will now be thoroughly checked to see what damage it took and what it will take to clean it up and reuse it. Eventually, this will be a less expensive and faster process than building one from scratch. So in a sense, this test isn’t over: Once a booster is reused, then it will show that the next step in spaceflight has been truly achieved (much like, in a historical sense, the second flight of the Space Shuttle was just as important as the first). This joyful event brought to you by Slate's interactive calendar of #goodthings that took place in 2015, and @thebadastronomer.\n\nAbove, A remodeled version of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifts off at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on the launcher’s first mission since a June failure in Cape Canaveral, Florida, December 21, 2015.

Or, at least, her version of it. “I don’t go about breaking up marriages. You can’t break up a happy marriage. [Debbie Fischer]'s and Eddie’s never has been.” When Hedda asked Liz if she loved Eddie, Liz responded, “I like him very much, I’ve felt happier and more like a human being for the past two weeks than I have since Mike’s death.” Mike Todd and Liz were a power couple, until his death in 1958 when his private jet named Liz plummeted to the ground in New Mexico. “What do you suppose Mike would say to this?” Hedda demanded to know. Elizabeth responded, “Well, Mike is dead and I’m alive.” This was an echo of one of Liz’s most famous lines in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof—or, you could say, a preview of it, since most of Hedda Hopper’s readers hadn’t yet seen the film. But Liz would offer Hedda a kicker that was more explicitly sexual than anything the movie when she exclaimed, “What do you expect me to do?

Pileus clouds are thin, cap-shaped, form above rapidly rising columns of air, and have tiny water droplets in them. And iridescence is a weird phenomenon. You need lots of tiny raindrops (or ice crystals) all the same size over a large portion of the cloud. In a rainbow, the lights goes into the droplets and gets bent (twice) to create colors. In iridescence, though, the light actually bends (diffracts) around the droplets. Different colors bend by different amounts, splitting the colors apart. The size of the raindrop needs to be roughly the same size as the wavelength of light, so when I say “tiny” I mean it: The drops must be less around a micron in size!
