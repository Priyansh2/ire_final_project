By 1991 the epidemic had claimed the lives of 100,000 Americans. But nobody was talking about the epidemic in any meaningful way. Haring's work helped to change that.

While the police waited outside the gay bar for their wagons, a crowd began to form. Officers became flustered and rough, and when one struck a female patron with a baton the throng became agitated. Pennies, bottles and stones began to fly; chants filled the streets of Greenwich Village. A riot erupted—one that would continue on the streets around Stonewall for five days, but that would also galvanise a much wider movement. America’s LGBTQ citizens stepped out from their underground venues, and into the street.⁠\n⁠\nThat was 50 years ago. This photo was taken on June 24th 1990, 20 years on from Stonewall, and it's clear that the LGBTQ community's relationship with the law had changed considerably by then.

Its prowess is something to behold. It hosts 37% of the world’s currency dealing and 18% of cross-border lending. It is a hub for derivatives, asset management, insurance and investment banking. It generates a quarter of its income from the continent, and Europe gets a quarter of its financial services from London. Yet Brexit threatens to rupture Britain’s financial links with the European Union. And if Labour wins the next election under Jeremy Corbyn, Britain will end up with its most left-wing government since 1945. Either would make the EU poorer and damage London’s position. Together, they could change the workings of the global financial system.⁠⠀\n⁠⠀\nIn our other editions we ask how to contain Iran? It is poised to breach the nuclear deal it signed with America and other powers in 2015. Although it is not about to become a nuclear-weapons power, it is once again using its programme to heap pressure on America. That adds an explosive new element to an already-volatile mix, which has seen strikes on six ships, the downing of an American drone and a cyber-attack on Iran. Neither President Donald Trump, nor America’s allies, nor Iran wants a big new war in the Middle East. Yet Mr Trump’s strategy of applying “maximum pressure” on Iran is making war more likely.

It was invented by Gianantonio Locatelli, a dairy farmer in Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy, after he realised that his 3,500-strong herd produced 50,000 litres of milk and 150,000kg of manure, far more than his farm’s annual output of Grana Padana cheese. Determined to do something useful with the waste, he experimented with mixing it into clay, and baking it as bricks, floor tiles, tableware – and toilets.

His early decades were marked by personal suffering: he was 10 when his mother was murdered, and by 20 he was an addict and petty thief who sold his own blood to make ends meet. Now his lifestyle is peaceful, housebound and nearly Amish in its lack of material indulgence. On an average day, he will eat a bowl of plain oatmeal and drink several cups of black filter coffee, engage in various acts of “prayer and ponder”, check in with his assistant by fax or on the landline, and take naps. Apart from writing the occasional movie treatment or magazine piece, Ellroy’s only commitment is the monkish, monomaniacal pursuit of what he identifies as “God’s calling for me as a novelist”.

She borrowed the idea of a portable structure with a metallic skeleton and a roof like a carousel’s top. She then selected aluminium for the 12 panels that make up the refuge’s exterior, which made it light and easy to assemble. What’s really striking is how small but capacious the structure is. It has a diameter of just 3.8 metres, yet, thanks to Perriand’s ingenious use of space, it can easily fit eight people inside, along with everything that a mountaineer might need for a weekend in the Alps.

A greater share of people with only a secondary education or less is in work now than in 2000. Even so, more high-skilled jobs are being created than menial ones and wage-growth is rising. In America, traditional full-time jobs made up the same proportion of employment in 2017 as they did in 2005. The jobs boom will not last for ever. Eventually, a recession will kill it off.

In Asia payment apps are a way of life for over 1bn users. In the West mobile banking is reaching critical mass—49% of Americans bank on their phones—and tech giants are muscling in. Change poses risks. Because the financial system is embedded in the economy, innovation tends to create turbulence, as when securitisation fed the subprime crisis. Yet the benefits of technological change are likely to be vast. If the world’s listed banks chopped expenses by a third, the saving would be worth $80 a year for every person on Earth. Rotten service will improve and the system will get better at its vital job of allocating capital to firms and consumers. #TheEconomist", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8366d23dec9668297c1e68ccb1bc3995/5E55625A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/58468543_429941871127028_6311537610402265883_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw-YmJgJ4e0/", "caption": "Leonardo da Vinci died on this day 500 years ago.

Highlights include the work of Muhammad Sadiq Bey, an Egyptian engineer whose wet-plate collodion camera captured the first shots of Mecca (first image) and Medina. Kassian Cephas, the first Indonesian professional photographer, documented Javanese court rituals, local religious festivals and Borodobur, a 9th century Buddhist temple. The Abdullah brothers captured sultans, aristocracy and visiting kings in late-Ottoman Constantinople. The history of photography is usually cast only in a Western light.

In medieval times the city was a stopping-off point for trade caravans, carrying gold, slaves, salt and ivory, that crisscrossed the Sahara on their way from the west-African kingdoms to the Mediterranean. It became fabulously wealthy. In the 14th century the Malian King Mansa Musa I – possibly the richest man the world has ever known – travelled through Timbuktu on a pilgrimage to Mecca with an entourage of 12,000 slaves and enough gold to cause hyperinflation in Mecca, Cairo and Medina. But by the 19th century Timbuktu’s glory days were long gone – and the Timbuktu of 2019 is an even sorrier sight. Decades of neglect by the Malian government and desertification in the surrounding countryside has left it impoverished. Today, it’s too dangerous for all but the hardiest travellers.

But when modern-style “safety” bikes – with pedals, brakes and rubber tyres – first appeared in the 1890s, they were seen as agents of radical social change. Beloved of socialists and suffragettes, bicycles became associated with emancipation and progress. Female cyclists abandoned impractical Victorian clothing for trousers or bloomers. Bikes had an immediate social impact in one area in particular: dating. Cyclists could now travel beyond their own communities, greatly increasing the number of potential marriage partners. In recent years another technology has expanded people’s social circles and dramatically broadened their romantic opportunities: online dating. Like bicycles, apps and websites bring together people who might otherwise not have met, but on a far larger scale. In America more than a third of marriages now start with a digital match-up.

But there is one small but significant silver lining: organ donations. In 2017 one in eight deceased organ donors in America died from an overdose, compared to one in 100 in 2000. Fatal drug overdoses usually kill by starving the brain of oxygen. As far as organ donation is concerned, brain death is the more useful kind. That is because it takes some time for the heart to register the loss of brain function and stop beating—at which point organs begin to deteriorate rapidly. This is good news for the 6,500 Americans who die on the waiting list for transplants each year—as well as for the 114,000 who are currently on the list, most of whom will not get lucky this year. And for some of the families bereaved by the opioids tragedy, the possibility that their loved ones may give a new lease of life to others may be a flicker of light in the darkness. #organdonation #America #USA", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/59fa7a92323ec512898e7f7a80890017/5E458C7D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/56567413_380630712790378_8102753669340747623_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwMKTN_JOSg/", "caption": "From @1843mag: A pioneering school of design founded in Germany 100 years ago, the Bauhaus was supposed to be a model of equality and progress.

Now he faces his greatest danger, in the form of criminal charges for corruption. As the threat has grown, he has railed against the free press, the judiciary and shadowy forces.

In many cases African-Americans were lynched for no recorded offence at all. Bryan Stevenson, the founder of the Equal Justice Initiative (EJI), argues that slavery morphed into lynch law, which then morphed into segregation and today, into mass incarceration – all of which reflect a desire to control and subjugate black people physically. Part of the reason racism persists today, he believes, is because Americans have not honestly confronted their history. To encourage America to face up to its racist past, the EJI has erected a memorial in Alabama to the thousands of victims of lynching.

AGI, which stands for artificial general intelligence, is a hypothetical computer program that can perform intellectual tasks as well as, or better than, a human. It will be able to complete discrete tasks, like recognising photos or translating languages – things our phones can already do. But it will also understand physics papers, compose novels, devise investment strategies and make delightful conversation with strangers. In 2014 Google acquired DeepMind, giving Hassabis the money to hire some of the world’s top computer scientists and brain researchers.

King Bibi is a political giant who embodied muscular nationalism, chauvinism and the resentment of elites long before such populism became a global force. Now he faces his greatest danger, in the form of criminal charges for corruption. As the threat has grown, he has railed against the free press, the judiciary and shadowy forces. Israeli politics is turning into a contest between genuine achievement and demagoguery on one side and the rule of law on the other. All who care about democracy should watch closely.\n\nOur cover in Britain dissects a week in which Theresa May, the prime minister, has offered to resign and Parliament has seized control of Brexit—sidelining the executive for the first time in over a century. Sadly, Mrs May’s sacrifice does nothing to solve Britain’s Brexit mess. Her resignation depends on Parliament voting through her deal after two crushing defeats. Even if she succeeds (a very big if), Parliament remains hopelessly divided about Britain’s future relationship with Europe. If her deal fails and Parliament forces its own alternative on her, she could resist. If she goes, the next prime minister’s Brexit plan will have no popular mandate.

Imagine it in biro rather than oil paints, and it’s something you might have scribbled during a particularly boring meeting. More than that, it is what people scrawl when they can’t draw: a stick-man, wobbly waves and V-shaped birds, surrounded by blobs, geometric shapes, a bit of lettering. Miró paints these things better than we might, but it remains a doodly mess. Still, there is loveliness in all this playful doodling.

But in the 19th century, producing a horizontal cut required a highly laborious and elaborate dissection. To make a series of cross-sections of the human head, William MacEwen, a Scottish surgeon, had to freeze the brain – which would otherwise “sink by its own weight and becomes distorted” – before slicing it up. The segments were then reproduced using photogravure, a photographic technique of the period notable for its high contrast, and then further edited to highlight specific features, like the boundaries between tissues. A new exhibition at the Royal College of Physicians, “Under the Skin”, shows how artists and scientists have sought to represent human anatomy from the Middle Ages until the 20th century.

A stroke in 2013 left him confined to a wheelchair; he has rarely spoken in public since. Yet he was to be the only real candidate in an election scheduled for April 18th. With him out of the race, the vote has been postponed. In a letter released by state media he—or his coterie—acknowledged his health problems and promised to leave “a new republic...in the hands of the new generations of Algerians.” Not right away, though. With the president incapacitated, a clique of generals and businessmen, known as le pouvoir, runs the country. The letter proposed a transitional period, with a national convention to draft a new constitution and which would be put to a public vote. There is talk of Lakhdar Brahimi, a veteran diplomat and former United Nations special envoy, heading the effort (he met with Mr Bouteflika after the president’s announcement). Elections will follow.

A palace “kahveci usta”, or coffee-master, might have tens of assistants helping him grind Arabica beans into an extra-fine powder similar in texture to today’s instant espresso.

The surprising thing is not that it has taken too long—the usual complaint of fans—but that it has happened so soon. A writer becomes eligible for membership 20 years after their first commercial release. Ms Elliott’s solo career began in 1997 so it has taken little more than two years of eligibility for her to receive the honour. It is richly deserved, given the consistently high quality of her music, but it is surprising nonetheless, given that the institution rarely recognises hip-hop artists. Ms Elliott is only rap’s third inductee after Jay-Z and Jermaine Dupri, and its first such woman. \nSo why is it that Ms Elliott is not recognised as belonging in the same rank of solo artists as Prince, Bowie and Bob Dylan? The answer lies, at least in part, in the fact that she is female. While women are often celebrated as singers and stars, it is much more difficult for them to be recognised as game-changing creative forces.

International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways and Iberia, carried 112.9m passengers last year, up 7.7% from 2017. But a nasty storm lies ahead: Brexit. Currently IAG’s airlines can operate flights anywhere within the European Union. It can also use any EU member-state’s treaty rights to fly to places outside the bloc. If a no-deal Brexit occurs, within nine months the firm will have to increase its ownership by EU investors to over 50% of the total to maintain its flying rights within the remaining member states. But whether British Airways will be able to continue using Britain’s treaties with third countries in that scenario is questionable. IAG has yet to say how it will square that circle.

It was a hideous thing, and yet there was a fascination about it somehow.” Animated by this same fascination, physicians and artists have, over the centuries, opened up the human body and recorded what they discovered inside. In a new exhibition at the Royal College of Physicians in London, “Under the Skin”, scrolls, prints and woodcuts show how these anatomists grappled with the challenges of representing the human body, and in so doing made illustrations that are as gruesome as they are compelling.

The choice of venue is intriguing. For America, Vietnam’s Communist Party is foe turned buddy, and it has blazed a trail of market reforms in the country. Mr Kim, presumably, is expected to look and learn. But he has steadfastly refused to emulate Vietnam’s economic transformation. And, though Mr Trump has confessed to falling in love with the young despot, North Korea and America have only just started dating.

Continue reading to discover how the 71-year-long struggle for control of Kashmir began.\n\nDisputed borders are both a cause and a symptom of tensions between big neighbours in South Asia. When the colonial power, Britain, withdrew from India it left a dangerous legacy of carelessly or arbitrarily drawn borders. Most contentious of all, however, are the borders in Kashmir, where Pakistan, India and China all have competing claims. By the time of independence, in 1947, it was clear that many Indian Muslims were determined to break off from Hindu-majority India. It fell to a British civil servant, who knew nothing of the region, to draw a line of partition between territory that would become Pakistan and India. Pakistan was given Muslim dominated areas in the far north west, plus territory in the east (which itself got independence as Bangladesh in 1971). The rulers of some disputed areas, notably Kashmir, were told to choose which country to join.\n\nWhile Kashmir's Hindu rulers procrastinated, hoping somehow to become an independent country, Pakistan's leaders decided to force the issue. Since Kashmir was (and is) a Muslim-majority territory, Pakistan felt justified in seeing Pushtun warlords charge in from the north-west of Pakistan, late in 1947, to seize control of Kashmir. In response India, apparently invited by Kashmir's rulers, deployed its national army and stopped the invaders taking Srinagar, Kashmir's capital, located in the Kashmir valley, the most coveted part of the territory. The resulting \"line of control\", by and large, remains the defacto international frontier within Kashmir. The recent cross-border aerial attacks are the first since a war in 1971. #territory #borders #maps #India #Pakistan #Kashmir #geopolitics", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b58676b9ccb29edcdfacfa0ce98b598d/5E48F737/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/52498869_297515497606720_2303700166775122042_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuX9zKDHjME/", "caption": "Visitors interact with the Qualcomm stand at MWC (formerly Mobile World Congress) Barcelona, the largest mobile fair in the world, Barcelona, Spain on February 26th 2019.

Unenamoured by Jamaica’s 25% corporate income-tax rate, some international firms with operations there find ways to shelter profits using the British Virgin Islands and other nearby tax havens. Since 2017, auditors from Tax Administration Jamaica (TAJ), the national tax authority, have received training to help them identify and challenge the tax planning of large firms. The assistance is offered by Tax Inspectors Without Borders (TIWB), a programme backed by the OECD and the UN.\n\nJamaica is not alone in suffering leakage. Estimates of uncollected revenues vary. The OECD reckons that exchequers worldwide lose $100bn-240bn a year to corporate tax avoidance. An IMF study in 2016 suggested that the total could be over $600bn—equivalent to a quarter of all corporate tax collected globally. Avoidance has grown in line with intangible assets, such as intellectual property, which are easier to shift to tax havens than physical assets. Poor countries are hit hardest because they rely more on corporate tax revenues than rich countries, and because international tax rules, originally crafted to suit advanced economies, are stacked against them. \nTo read the full article search \"Reclaiming the booty\" at economist.com Credit: Alamy/AF archive #pirates #treasure #taxhaven #ships", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3da4050c3a10411a70b207d8936932dc/5E605F8D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c123.0.834.834a/s640x640/53026481_381668912626629_1195492398033774095_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuRvoC1HvkV/", "caption": "From @1843mag: In 2010, Gianni Botsford bought a plot in west London, and began thinking about how to sculpt an ingenious modern building on this tiny handkerchief of land.

At the behest of the Danish government, a five-foot steel fence is being built along the 70 km (40-mile) border to prevent an influx of immigrants from the rest of Europe. Mr Ellermann thinks it an aesthetic affront that violates the European ethos of invisible borders. \nThe immigrants in question are wild boar, which can carry African Swine Fever (ASF). Although the disease has not yet been diagnosed in Germany, there have been outbreaks in eastern Europe and Belgium; and diseases travel fast among Europe’s vast numbers of boar. The virus poses no threat to humans but it spreads easily to domestic pigs, killing nearly all it infects. There is no cure and no vaccine, so the Danes have opted for a radical solution: shoot all the boar in Denmark and keep out foreign ones.\nEradicating an entire species (albeit temporarily) seems an extreme approach to agricultural insurance, but Denmark has almost three times as many pigs as inhabitants. An outbreak of ASF would threaten more than 30,000 jobs and more than €4bn ($4.5bn) of annual exports of pig meat, which account for half of the country’s agricultural exports.\nFor the full article search \"Can a border fence keep out wild boar?\" at economist.com Credit: DPA/picture alliance/Reiner Bernha #boar #Germany #Denmark #agriculture", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/735b3389929dee6fb678a1807e2fb281/5E5ADF60/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/51023179_488175264920154_8493794992994000566_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuKxUBgHKOw/", "caption": "Our cover argues that President Xi Jinping should reform China’s economy—both to calm the trade war with America and to make his country richer.

In the unthreatening environment of the Everglades, their population has since grown enormously – and is decimating the native wildlife. In 2017, the South Florida authorities began to enlist hired hunters to counter the threat posed by pythons: they gave them a licence, access to restricted land and payment in cash for every python caught.

Pakistan’s ties with the Gulf are entering a new stage. Adept at using its strategic location to secure foreign investment, Pakistan relies increasingly on Gulf benefactors.

MBS is now expected to sign a record investment package worth $14bn. The cash throws Mr Khan a lifeline, while boosting the Saudis’ oil sales and plugging them into China’s new trade network in Pakistan. Its leaders hope MBS will be back soon.

The penultimate evening, for example, was an exploration of the queer undercurrents of Arab electronica. A few days earlier, Afrofuturist poetry was married with modulating dub basslines. Even when the music hewed more closely to the familiar sounds of house and techno, it was being played by rising stars such as LSDXOXO, HVL and DJ Rachael, who came to prominence livening up the underground scenes in their respective cities of New York, Tbilisi and Kampala.

Two weeks had passed since the shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, had left the country amid enormous protests against his autocratic rule. Khomeini’s aides were eager for the ayatollah to return from exile in Paris and fill the power vacuum. But the government left behind by the shah warned them to stay away. As their plane approached Iranian airspace, the air force threatened to shoot it down. Some on board cheered the chance for martyrdom. The Western journalists in tow were more subdued. \nThe plane eventually landed in Tehran and, after a brief argument between his followers over who would assist him, Khomeini walked slowly down the stairs to the tarmac, helped by an Air France steward (a compromise). He was greeted in the capital by what some believe to be the largest crowd in history. The date was February 1st 1979. Ten violent days later, the shah’s government resigned and the army gave way to the revolutionaries.\nFor the full article search \"The shadow of 1979\" at economist.com Credit: Getty Images/Sygma/Alain Dejean  #Iran #1979 #AyatollahKhomeini #Tehran", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9ea94dd1560b50a4bef4a073ddc0f2c2/5E5289F2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/51049450_101838770918047_2044076537893292907_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Btl6qD3nSoh/", "caption": "A Pekingese plays in a park in Beijing on February 8th 2018.

Specifically, it likes to crawl into car-engine cavities and chew on the wiring. As a result, in Germany, car insurance that covers Marderbisse (marten bites) is a must. According to GDV, an insurers’ group, martens were the fourth-leading cause of non-collision auto damage in Germany in 2017. They chewed through €72m ($79m) worth of cables, up from €66m the year before and €28m in 2005. In 2016 one hopped onto an electric transformer at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland, short-circuiting it and briefly knocking out the particle accelerator. Earlier that year the LHC lost power when a cable was chewed through by an animal which, though rather charred, appears to have been a marten.

As the Taliban has consolidated its hold on parts of Afghanistan, where 85% of the world’s heroin is made, more of the country has been given over to poppies. In 2017 opium production increased by 65% to 10,500 tonnes, the highest recorded by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, since it began collecting data in 2000. Not only is there more heroin being produced, but a rising share of the crop is being trafficked via Africa. The so-called Balkan route, encompassing Iran, Turkey and south-east Europe, has been the main way of getting heroin to the West. But over the past decade moving drugs along it has become harder, a side-effect of Turkey tightening its borders in response to the war in Syria and European countries’ attempts to keep out refugees. As a result, more of the harvests are being dispatched along the “southern route” (see map).

This quietly beautiful building in the suburbs of Japan’s capital is a satisfying architectural homecoming. A lattice of cypress timbers make up its enigmatic façade, a playful reference to Chidori, a centuries-old Japanese toy comprising timber sections that can be assembled to create abstract geometric structures as well as miniature furniture.

A survey in 2018 by kpmg and Harvey Nash, a firm of headhunters, found that only a fifth of it bosses thought their firm was well prepared for an attack. That gloomy assessment is borne out by high-profile hacks. In 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, two malware programs, scrambled files in organisations across the world. Maersk, a Danish shipping firm, said it had suffered costs of $300m. Such mishaps are feeding a fast-growing market for specialist cyber-insurance. Solid numbers are in short supply, but Munich Re, a reinsurer, reckons that a market that wrote $4bn of premiums in 2018 could be writing $8bn-9bn by 2020. Rob Smart of Mactavish, a firm that works with big British insurers, says that “almost all” the firms’ clients have inquired about cyber-insurance in the past couple of years.

President Donald Trump was the first to endorse him; Canada and all the major economies in South America followed.\n\nFor the full article search \"One republic, two presidents\" at economist.com Credit: AFP/Federico Parra #Venezuela #JuanGuaido #elections #politics #flags", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ad807f485d7cceec8fff222db990d998/5E5D1E5D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/50690852_1176715365831127_5935585381249387480_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtBTsbMnXy_/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2e51cfe93289d4447334d2cccce64420/5DC24BB7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/49858184_364619054119153_490596998392273848_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtAbGKRHHXx/", "caption": "Flood-affected residents transport a motorcycle using a makeshift bamboo raft in Makassar, Indonesia on January 23rd 2019.

So expensive, in fact, that the Malaysian government has reportedly considered handing its two adult pandas back to China, the country from which all pandas originate. As part of an agreement made by its disgraced former prime minister, Najib Razak, in 2014 Malaysia must pay China $1m each year to rent the bears until 2024. The new Malaysian government, which took power in May 2018, has been reviewing the deal, and this month the prime minister had to refute ministerial claims that the pandas would be returned early. Why does Malaysia have to pay so much?\n\nChina has offered pandas as gifts since the seventh century, when Empress Wu sent two bears to Japan. The tradition resurfaced under Mao Zedong. Russia and North Korea were given pandas during the cold war, and America got a pair after President Nixon’s China trip in 1972. By giving its national animal to a foreign power, China is able to emphasise the closeness of political ties. But as China has grown increasingly capitalist, pandas have become an economic tool as well. Instead of giving them away, in the 1980s China started loaning them for $50,000 per month, with the bears and any offspring remaining Chinese property. \nA member of staff carries a female panda born a year ago at the National Zoo in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. For the full article search \"Panda\" at economist.com Credit: AP/Vincent Thian #panda #China #zoo #Malaysia", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fd1e3f92e25147590fbe3b24540ef5bb/5E47D235/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c104.0.871.871a/s640x640/49771679_756903451332987_7323924560279601634_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs1DR8inZo3/", "caption": "From @1843mag: James Bond was a man who knew exactly which brands he wanted, to the point of specifying Perrier as his preferred sparkling water.

The finances were sound—Disney had outdone its competitors at the box office the year before—but Mr Katzenberg felt the company was unduly focused on blockbusters. It should be less fixated on big budgets, big names and whizzy effects, he urged, and concentrate on developing original ideas and executing them well. “People don’t want to see what they’ve already seen,” he said. “Our job is not to count on recycled formulas, but to create and develop fresh, new stories.” But since then the studio seems to have found a magic formula: extravagant remakes of animated fantasies that audiences already love. In 2019 it will add “Dumbo”, “Aladdin” and “The Lion King” to its roster of “live-action remakes”.

The male-grooming industry has long focused on selling products that are marketed to negotiate masculine, heteronormative insecurities by emphasising performance over aesthetics. So a moisturiser claims to “attack” wrinkles, a deodorant “eliminates” perspiration and an exfoliator “purges” dry skin. The next time you’re in an area of the pharmacy dedicated to men, check out the labels: the language of the masculine bathroom shelf is imbued with the idea of being a warrior. The unfortunate thing is that instead of “beauty” men get “grooming”, a term often applied to horses, dogs and hamsters. But male cosmetic products are changing: a number of brands, like @chanelofficial and @tomford, have started to present items as beautifying, purely aesthetic tools rather than spurious performance enhancers.

That attracted the attention of our in-house style overlords. They ruled that “cryptocurrency” should become one word, rather than two hyphenated ones. Our choice for word of the year, however, is “tariffs”. Thanks to Donald Trump’s trade skirmishes and Britain’s painful divorce from Europe, the word has appeared in nine of our cover leaders. In all, we used it three times as often in 2018 as we did the year before.

Back in their hotel that night after one too many drinks, Mick Jagger suddenly decides that he wants to see Charlie Watts. Jagger picks up the phone, calls Watts’s room and says, “Where’s my drummer?” There was no response. Twenty minutes later, Watts, dressed in one of his Savile Row suits, knocks on Jagger’s door, shouts “Never call me your drummer again”, and delivers a sharp right hook to the singer’s chin. Rock stars may seem to exist in a completely different world to our own, but they, too, are subject to office politics. It was Jagger who took responsibility for the band’s major business decisions, but by calling Watts “my” drummer, he had upset the delicate balance of deference and respect that sustains the relationships between co-workers in any workplace.

As the eradication endgame drags on, another problem is becoming more visible: cases of vaccine-derived polio. In rare occasions, the weakened virus in the oral vaccine, used in developing countries, can mutate into a form resembling the paralysing wild virus. That happens when the virus in the vaccine, which a vaccinated person excretes for a short time, is ingested by someone unvaccinated, and passed on further; the first people in the chain of transmission get some immunity but if the chain persists for over a year, the virus gradually accumulates mutations that make it dangerous again. In 2018 nearly 100 vaccine-derived cases emerged, in five countries. They now outnumber cases from the wild virus, a tip of the scale that is a side-effect of the nearing end of polio.

Rape as a weapon of war — Visually representing such a sensitive topic with tact is not easy. Andrea Ucini struck the balance perfectly in creating a powerful but tasteful image. \n3. Putting the data into dating — Noma Bar’s deceptively simple illustrations use negative space to create images that often carry double meanings.\n4.  What if there was no moon? — Mike McQuade’s elegant artwork accompanies an abstract idea (from our annual “The World If” supplement) that the Moon and early life on Earth might be more closely linked than we thought. \n5. Japan’s rapprochement with China — Swiss illustrator Till Lauer creates artwork for our weekly Banyan column. His delightful style is at once simple, bold and impactful. \n6. I know what you’ll do next summer — “Data Detectives”, our Technology Quarterly on surveillance and justice, was illustrated entirely in “graphic novel” style by Simon Myers over 17 narrative cartoon-strip cells.\n7. Against the tyranny of the majority — Gastón Mendieta's distinctive style provided the brand identity for The Economist’s Open Future initiative, tackling broad and complex areas of debate such as migration, assisted dying and freedom of speech.\n8. Parents worry more about bullying than anything else — Lisa Tegtmeier cleverly puts you in the victim’s shoes with a strong, colourful illustration.\n9. Working longer hours has drawbacks — Paul Blow illustrates Bartleby, a new weekly column introduced in the summer, where he imagines the themes of work and management as charming, witty visuals.\n10.

Acknowledged “masters” of Origamiusa have included Michael LaFosse, a marine biologist, and John Montroll, an electrical engineer. It was surely not a coincidence that one of Oppenheimer’s highly mathematical children, Martin Kruskal, spent time studying the folding-up of spacetime inside black holes. In 1989 a few such enthusiasts convened the first meeting devoted to exploring what origami could contribute to science and engineering. Robert Lang, an origami artist and former laser physicist, says that meeting in Ferrara, Italy, \"played an outsized role in the triggering of the explosive growth that we're now in the middle of, because it brought together isolated individuals and fields\". He should know. Since hanging up his lab coat and taking origami on full time Dr Lang has had a hand in a mind-bending array of pursuits both academic and artistic, penning 22 origami how-to books along the way.

He was a healthy baby; the knot in his umbilical cord seemed inconsequential. But by the end of his first year, he wasn’t hitting development milestones. His mother noticed that Ethan wasn’t sitting up or crawling at the same stage as her first two boys. They made many visits to doctors and the family worked intensively with Ethan over the next few years. But no one could give them a diagnosis. The cerebellum is understood to be the brain’s quality assessment centre, ensuring that actions the higher brain has decided on go according to plan. As well as supervising the smooth running of the body through endless cycles of error correction, the cerebellum helps the brain and the body to learn from their mistakes and miscommunications. “The cerebellum does the same thing to emotion and cognition that it does for motor control,” says Jeremy Schmahmann, a neurologist at Harvard Medical School who focuses on the cerebellum. Just as physical movements are monitored, controlled and regulated by the cerebellum, so too, it turns out, are other sorts of thought, including speech and emotional work. The set of mental actions required to remain calm under pressure, for instance, runs through the cerebellum. All this takes place far below the threshold of consciousness. It is a sort of internalised automation, allowing process to go on in the background without any attention. You don’t know that you are doing it. But you would notice very quickly if you stopped. Ethan had his first brain scan in 2010, just after his 4th birthday. By this stage, his doctors had begun to suspect a damaged cerebellum. But that was not what the scan showed. His cerebellum was not damaged. It was absent; there was a featureless dark fluid-filled hole where the cerebellum would be. His brain—or his body, depending which way round you look at it—lacked an autopilot. This is one of our Christmas articles.

Today there are perhaps 10,000 baijiu distillers in China, producing 10bn litres each year, more than twice the annual global production of vodka, the next most popular spirit. Baijiu is a broad family of grain-based spirits selling for anything between a few dollars and a few thousand dollars per bottle. The primary ingredient is sorghum, or sometimes rice. In contrast to whisky or beer-making, these grains are fermented while solid. This requires them to be mixed with a fermenting agent and then heaped in mounds, packed in buried jars or sometimes sealed pits. The pungent product is distilled by heating in a still that operates like a steamer, to produce high-alcohol liquid. Production can take anything from a week up to nine months. The spirit is then aged in large ceramic jars. What results is a startling variety of products, commonly drunk above 50% proof. Photos taken in Chengdu, China, on September 20th 2016.

It caused a scandal. Millet had long made a point of painting peasants at their labours, but this big canvas was his strongest provocation. Into a decorous world of silks and parasols it introduced rough women, plump in their homespun skirts, rumps in the air, grubbing for ears of grain dropped after the harvest. One critic complained of \"ugliness and grossness unrelieved\". Another said it made him think of the scaffolds and pikes of the Terror of 1793. Millet had seen the women differently. He found them dignified, doing their work in a sanctifying late-summer light, companions to his peasant \"Angelus\". In this, as well as their humble roughness, he caught the essence of gleaning. To begin with, it is not scavenging. To scavenge means to search for things that others have discarded, as children rummage for plastic bottles and phone parts on the rubbish tips of Delhi. Nor is gleaning foraging, which is to gather foodstuffs from the wild, as fashionable restaurateurs scramble for chanterelles and samphire. Nor is it scrumping, which is stealing, usually on a dare. Items which are gleaned are the good and usable fruit of human activity; they have not been discarded, merely overlooked, or thought not worth bothering with.

Around 160 languages are spoken across the borough; residents hail from almost 200 countries. Nearly half its residents are foreign-born; most speak a language other than English at home.

In several, researchers have discovered emotions, intelligence and behaviour once thought to belong exclusively to humans. But the law has changed slowly, and in one respect barely at all. Most legal systems, whether based on common law or civil codes, treat the subjects of law as either people or property. There is no third category. Legal persons possess rights—guaranteed protections. Property does not. Because domesticated animals are economic assets, the law has always regarded animals as property. Some lawyers and animal-rights advocates say the time has come to change that, arguing that it is justified both by science and by rising concerns about animal welfare. Opponents reply that to give animals rights would not only be unprecedented but, by erasing distinctions between them and people, would undermine something fundamental to being human. For years, people seeking to improve the lives of animals have sponsored animal-welfare laws. “The law is a patchwork,” says Kristen Stilt, who teaches animal law at Harvard Law School. Animals still lack rights, but the bright line separating them from people has been dulled by sentience laws and rulings in India, Argentina and Colombia. As a judge said, in a case brought on behalf of a chimpanzee in an American zoo, “the question will have to be addressed eventually...

Joanne Orlando, a researcher in technology and learning at Western Sydney University, blames the mechanics of social media, which prize constant validation from others. Since people are more likely to comment on dynamic selfies than static ones, many are reluctant to upload anything that looks too ordinary. Algorithms on many platforms reinforce that tendency. If a particular pose or shot proves popular, then it is served up to more people. Other users, seeing its success, may try to match or outdo the stunt in order to be rewarded by that same process.

His aim is to bring awareness to the deadly fate awaiting many marine animals thanks to warming waters and other environmental hazards. “A single photo can be the most powerful conservation tool,” he says. Here, he captures an Australian sea lion looking into the lens with imperious disdain, as if he has just been disturbed from his afternoon nap in the soft vegetation at the bottom of a clear ocean. It is an intimate portrait, the apparent perfection of his sleek fur and well-groomed whiskers conjuring an image of a retired colonel. According to the Seal Conservation Society, there are an estimated 10,000-12,000 Australian sea lions remaining in the world, a number that may be declining.

What was created in the 19th century as a rubber-soled, simply uppered form of footwear named “sand shoes” or “plimsolls” has evolved in the 21st into a product of fantastic variety upon which hundreds of millions of people spend tens of billions of pounds a year. The Nike Dunk Low SB is one of the 21st century’s most-collected and -coveted sneaker designs. In 2005 the Pigeon edition sparked a minor riot in Manhattan when it was released in limited numbers, making the front page of the New York Post. The edition pictured here is the eBay Dunk; it is one of just two pairs ever made. It was named after eBay because it was auctioned on the website, reaching a price of $26,000.

Temporary summer jobs, many of them in agriculture, are often taken by migrants who return home afterwards. Temporary winter jobs, by contrast, more often go to locals. The difference is in part because winter work usually requires language skills and is less likely to be covered by special visa schemes, says Andrew Chamberlain of Glassdoor, an employer-review site. Which points to a merry Christmas for job-seeking Americans. But the tight jobs market is speeding up a longer-run trend, which may in time flatten seasonal spikes in demand for labour. That is automation. Amazon is ahead of the pack here, too. It is hiring 20,000 fewer workers in America this winter compared with last year, which Mark May, an analyst at Citigroup, attributes to greater use of robots in the retail giant’s fulfilment centres. Since many retail and delivery tasks are ripe for automation, this trend could terminate swathes of holiday jobs. That would make the season less of a scramble for employers. But the economy as a whole could lose out in a less obvious way. Many people need extra cash over Christmas, and the annual hiring binge means they can easily find work. Some decide to continue, even if that had not been the original plan. UPS says that it ends up hiring a third of its seasonal package-handlers for permanent jobs. Holiday work thus acts as a path from economic inactivity into the labour force.  For the full story search \"Spirit of Christmas yet to come\" at economist.com Credit: Reuters/Mark Makela #SantaClause #FatherChristmas #shopping #retail #USA #America #Christmas", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d754b2a1ae3f80f527fb491f4b4bafbb/5E45ECA4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47582197_264480407562290_5416766641303640712_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BrW2hM5nKHO/", "caption": "An operator takes a sample at blast furnace 2 in the Schwelgern coke plant of Thyssenkrupp, Duisburg, Germany on December 10th 2018.

It took the form of a life-size wooden figure, dressed in Turkish clothing, seated behind a cabinet which had a chessboard on top. The Mechanical Turk’s clockwork arm could reach out, move pieces on the board and beat even the best players at chess. But this apparently intelligent machine actually depended on a human chess player cleverly concealed in its innards. It turns out that something very similar is happening today. Just like the Turk, modern artificial-intelligence (AI) systems rely on help from unseen humans. Training a “deep learning” system involves showing it millions of examples of an input (such as photographs of animals) and telling it what the correct output is (“cat”, “dog”) in each case. Once trained, the system can then correctly identify animals in pictures it has not seen before. But the training process requires huge numbers of correctly labelled examples – and those must be created by humans.

Every year, the company he founded, @mbandf, launches an inventively designed timekeeper in collaboration with the French and Swiss clockmaker, L’Epée 1839. The most controversial piece in MB&F’s armoury is Arachnophobia, a giant spider containing an eight-day movement in a linear arrangement, with the clockwork set in the arachnid’s heady and body. Inspired by “Maman”, a huge spider sculpture created by artist Louise Bourgeois in 1999, Büsser says Arachnophobia represents his personal fascination with irrational fears: “I wanted to create a cross between real and mechanical and it has created more reaction than any other piece I have made”.

Many argue that MPs must vote for what they believe to be a damaging plan, out of respect for the referendum. They are wrong. It is far from clear that Mrs May’s plan reflects the will of the people. It breaks many of her own negotiating red lines, never mind the promises made by referendum campaigns. The government has largely given up arguing that its deal will be good for the country, instead insisting that it is what democracy demands. Yet no one can claim to intuit what the people want. The only way to know is to ask them in a second referendum.\n\nIn our other editions we analyse the crisis engulfing France’s president, Emmanuel Macron. His election in May 2017 seemed to herald new optimism about France, Europe and the world. In office he has reformed labour markets, training and education. Yet along the way, Mr Macron forgot that democracy requires the constant forging of consent. This week, as yellow-jacketed protesters rioted in Paris and blocked fuel depots and roads in the countryside, France looked unreformable. It is depressingly easy to conclude that have-your-cake-and-eat-it populism will always triumph over reform, but all is not lost for Mr Macron.

Rather than develop one from scratch, a NASA technician walked incognito into a shop in Houston, bought a series of chronographs – watches that display time and can also be used as a stopwatch – and took them back for the agency to test them. NASA subjected each timepiece to extreme temperatures, shocks, vibrations, humidity, acceleration and high pressure. One passed every test: the @omega Speedmaster, launched in 1957 (renamed the Speedmaster Professional in 1966). It remains NASA’s watch of choice for space missions and one of Omega’s most popular lines: the brand has created more than 100 different special editions, sold under catchy names like “Dark Side of the Moon” (pictured here).

In most countries, teachers earn less than similarly well-educated workers in other professions. Various reasons are suggested for this, such as job security, parent-friendly working hours and generous pensions. Another possible reason is their workload: the last lesson of the day often ends by mid-afternoon and teachers benefit from the long holidays granted to their students. However, they also toil outside the classroom, preparing for lessons, marking homework and being harangued by pushy parents. In a recent survey across 35 countries conducted by the Varkey Foundation, an education charity that favours higher status for teachers, the average respondent among 35,000 adults estimated that teachers worked 39 hours per week. Yet the average teacher among 5,500 surveyed claimed to work 43.\n\nDespite underestimating teachers’ workload, people still think they are underpaid. In 28 of the 35 countries surveyed, teachers make less than the public deems fair. The average respondent said that a fair wage would be 31% more than teachers actually earn. However, not everyone who tells a pollster that pedagogues should be more generously paid will vote for higher taxes to make that easier. Nor will many parents cheer the idea of larger classes, which would also make it easier to pay teachers more. #data #chart #teaching #education", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/143682b07a55086d1540845a2124084a/5E61009B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/45554849_263098711046974_5812122468616922283_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bq2O56ang9q/", "caption": "The red ribbon, seen here in Kathmandu, Nepal, is the universal symbol of awareness and support for people living with HIV.

A global network of some 160 international smuggling routes funnels hundreds of tonnes of animals and scales, many of them to China. There, pangolin scales are used in traditional medicine: the state supplies 26 tonnes of scales to hospitals each year, and scales can legally be bought in pharmacies.

Icke’s audacious staging, from the stripped-back minimalism of “Mary Stuart” to the CCTV footage that provided the backdrop to “Hamlet”, and his willingness to rewrite texts, no matter how revered their authors, has led one reviewer to characterise his plays as “dyno-rod theatre, blasting open clogged pipes to show how galvanising staple theatrical plots can be”.

But since 2001, when Portugal decriminalised most drug use, the number of addicts has plummeted. Under this law, illegal drugs remain illegal and dealers are prosecuted. But possession for personal use is an administrative offence, not a criminal one. Anyone caught with a 10-day supply or less is ordered to visit the local Commission for Dissuasion of Drug Addiction. Rehabilitation programmes and opiate substitutes, such as methadone, are available to all users who want to quit. The number of problem heroin users has since fallen to about 33,000. The government can claim only partial credit; drug epidemics tend to fizzle. But decriminalisation and treatment helped cut Portugal’s overdose rate to one of the lowest in Europe. As for America, in 2016 it had 63,600 fatal overdoses. In Portugal there were 27.

By the 1950s, Mickey was a veritable media sensation, with films, comic strips, television programmes, merchandise and even amusement parks to his name. In 1953, to mark his quarter-century, Mickey’s official portraitist, John Hench, painted this perky picture, which expresses the character’s unique personality.

She seems to appeal in particular to the young and the over-65s. When the first lady visited a lycée in Dijon earlier this year, one observer described the reaction of the pupils as “quasi-hysterical”. Celebrity magazines have dubbed the phenomenon “Bibimania”. But unlike in America, where the current First Lady Melania Trump is under constant scrutiny for her perceived inability to meet the demands of her role, the position of the French first lady comes with no particular expectation: “I don’t feel like a first lady,” Macron told “Elle” magazine last year, considering the term to be merely “the translation of an American expression”.

That is about the same as the number killed in the whole of 2017, excluding terrorist attacks. Four in ten victims were 24 years old or younger. The media has good reason to pay close attention to murders in the city. Stabbings are far more common in London than anywhere else in the country, and not only because it is so much bigger: it sees more violence per person than less populous areas do. Yet the biggest increases in knife crime have been outside London (see chart). Since 2010-11 it has risen by a tenth there, and by a third in the rest of England and Wales. During the same period, knife crime leapt more sharply than the national average in the patches around Sheffield, Leeds and Liverpool. The number of stabbings began to tick up in North Wales, Norfolk and Essex well before they did in London. What explains the rise? Labour blames spending cuts: the number of police officers has fallen by 15% since 2010. Another plausible explanation is a shift in the drugs market. A boom in the supply of crack cocaine has encouraged city gangsters to expand into towns once dominated by small-time dealers. Competition has sparked violent turf wars. #data #chart #knifecrime #London", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/241f71899bde68db705eaf4bb01a8eb8/5E56D6FB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/45392448_278882432832157_3772761489192861119_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BqRwNCVnmcD/", "caption": "From @1843mag: Following the vote to leave the European Union, Britain – or parts of it anyway – is going through the stages of grief. While the prime minister is bargaining, and many members of parliament are in denial, millions of Britons are still angry. Last month a march through London calling for a new referendum attracted 700,000 placard-wielding Remainers. But the sort of protest 1843’s correspondent found himself at last Thursday was much smaller and more intimate. Helen Masacz, an artist with an impish streak of humour, had invited the public to deface her portrait of Boris Johnson, the country’s most prominent Brexit-supporting politician, at the opening night of an exhibition at a gallery located on London’s ritzy Pall Mall. Masacz first exhibited the portrait in 2010, when her subject was London’s broadly popular mayor. By the time the painting was returned to her, the artist found that her opinion of Johnson had changed, as had that of many other Britons. So, rather than letting him be immortalised as a statesman on canvas, she invited others to add to the portrait.

But according to Gérard Liger-Belair, a physicist and “bubble-ologist” at the University of Reims, the flute’s iconic shape causes a build-up of carbon dioxide in the headspace of the glass that interferes with the process of nosing. If you really want to get the full aroma of a champagne, he says, then you’re better off drinking out of a white-wine glass. It also helps if the glasses haven’t been cleaned too well; the fibres cast off from paper and cloth create the tiny air pockets that bubbles need to form. If you poured champagne into a glass that was surgically clean, it wouldn’t bubble at all.

After ordering Leiter’s scotch, Bond “looked carefully at the barman. ‘A dry martini,’ he said. ‘One. In a deep champagne goblet…Three measures of Gordon’s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold, then add a large, thin slice of lemon peel.” The following night, Bond named the martini Vesper, after the woman he had just met and would soon love. It’s an early example of the attention to detail and undiluted glamour that gave Fleming’s books their cinematic feel. The international intrigue speaks for itself: how could being a dapper, globetrotting spy fail to excite? And cocktails were key to Bond’s image – and his allure.

The share that is content has dropped from 44% to 24%, its lowest level since the survey began more than two decades ago. That does not mean most Latin Americans are ready to dump democracy, which has become the norm across the region only since the 1980s. More than half say that it is better than any other system, though that has dropped by 13 percentage points over the past eight years. Disillusioned democrats lean towards indifference. The share who are neutral has risen from 16% in 2010 to 28%, while support for authoritarian government is steady, at about 15%. “People don’t like the democracy they are experiencing,” says Marta Lagos, the head of Latinobarómetro. In Latin America’s two biggest countries, Brazil and Mexico, that sentiment has resulted in the election of presidents this year who until recently would have been widely considered too radical to lead their countries.

Known as the Alfred Jewel, it is inscribed with the words AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN – or, in modern English, “Alfred ordered me to be made”. Historians believe it formed the bulbous end of an aestel, a device used to follow along with a text while reading. The dragon-shaped head has a hole for its “mouth”, into which an narrow ivory stick would have been placed to point with.

The sultan wanted him to design a bridge over the Bosphorus to unite Europe with Asia, and promised the artist an extravagant sum. Michelangelo was intrigued by the challenge, not least because his rival, Leonardo da Vinci, had earlier presented his own design for the bridge, which had been judged a failure. In 1506 he disembarked in the Ottoman capital; the city drew him in immediately. In a short but magical novel, “Tell Them of Battles, Kings and Elephants”, Mathias Enard conjures up Michelangelo’s love affair with Constantinople.

The atoms in your body come from the food and drink you consume – and, to some extent, from the air you breathe. That is not terribly surprising. What few people realise, however, is that about half the nitrogen atoms in your body have passed through something called a Haber-Bosch reaction. This chemical process, invented just before the first world war, did as much to change the world during the 20th century as the atom bomb or the microchip. Its story deserves to be more widely known, not just because it revolutionised agriculture but because it offers hope today for a fight whose front line is fast approaching: the battle against climate change.

The mid-term elections are just over a week away. Our mathematical model of the race calculates that the Democrats’ most likely share of votes cast for House candidates (excluding third parties, and adjusting for districts where candidates run unopposed) is just over 54%. That would be a bigger opposition-party wave than those of 1994, 2006, 2010 and 2014, and fall just short of 2008, when voters pummelled Republicans during the financial crisis. It is consistent with a narrow Democratic House majority, of around 12 seats. Nonetheless, a takeover is far from assured. Thanks to gerrymandering and to the concentration of Democratic voters in big cities, the Democrats need to win about 53.5% of the vote—roughly their margin in their wave of 2006—just to exceed a 50/50 chance of taking control.

Each “skin” affords its own level of status. The coolest right now is a sleek black suit based on the one worn by action protagonist John Wick, played by Keanu Reeves.

I love it!” Andy Warhol told the magazine’s art director, George Lois. The Sixties were the heyday of both ‘Esquire’ and pop art, the movement which made Warhol famous. Lois, who is said to have been the inspiration for Don Draper, the protagonist of “Mad Men”, was dismissive of pop art and, when ‘Esquire’ did a story about it, designed a spoof cover. He later said of his design that “you could look at it as just funny or…as how fame swallows people.” In those pre-computer days, the photo effect was achieved by dropping marbles into the soup to create a hole filled with a cut-out of Warhol. “When we put Andy into the soup, we almost lost him,” Lois drily remarked.

The trouble is that he’s also devoted to Simoncino, a neighbourhood thug with fists the size of boxing gloves and a head that looks like it’s made of breezeblocks. Marcello supplies him with cocaine and drives his getaway car but gets nothing but bullying in return. Still, no dog can be kicked for ever without eventually biting his owner.

Rarely was the practical task of textile creation considered an artistic pursuit. One woman changed that. Anni Albers, a German artist who studied at the Bauhaus art-and-design school, transformed the ancient craft of weaving into a Modernist art form by proving that woven textiles were just as relevant to high art as they were to everyday design. Her experiments with colour, material and form changed textile design forever – but despite Albers’s artistic contributions, she remained less well known than her male Bauhaus peers. A new retrospective exhibition at the Tate Modern in London recognises her for the visionary she was.

The phrase has come to encapsulate the idea that sexual misconduct and assault are underreported. Yet surveys suggest that this year-long storm of allegations, confessions and firings has actually made Americans more sceptical about sexual harassment. In the first week of November 2017, YouGov polled 1,500 Americans about their attitudes on the matter, on behalf of The Economist (swipe to see data for each survey question). In the final week of September 2018, it conducted a similar poll again. When it came to questions about the consequences of sexual assault and misconduct, there was a small but clear shift against victims. The change of opinion has been more pronounced among women than among men. But rather than breaking along gender lines, the #MeToo divide increasingly appears to be a party-political one. One effect of the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court may have been to turn #MeToo into yet another issue pitting Republicans against Democrats.

Yemen's civil war began four years ago, when Houthi rebels, backed by Iran, seized much of the country, including the capital Sana'a. Yemen relies on imports for 90% of its food. The Saudi-led coalition laid siege to the rebel-held port of Hodeida from the moment it entered the war. Its bombing has badly damaged facilities, disabling the cranes which unload cargo. As supplies have dwindled, levels of hunger have risen sharply.

Yet the term was coined in 1925 by Franz Roh, a German art historian, who observed that many artists in the Weimar Republic rejected the idealistic style fashionable before the first world war in favour of a realism with uncanny elements. While much of the work on show is bleak, savage and pessimistic, we also see energy and optimism – and occasionally even humour. The Weimar magic realists returned again and again to the circus as a theme, never with more striking results than in Albert Birkle’s fifth portrait of the acrobat Schultz (1921), capturing the extravagant facial expressions for which the performer was renowned.

But in Britain they have become among the least likely. Between 1986 and 2017 the suicide rate among the over-60s dropped by about 60%. This trend puzzles experts, but several changes may help to explain why British pensioners are less likely to kill themselves. \nOne is that their quality of life has got much better. The number of old people living in poverty is close to its lowest-ever level. After housing costs, their incomes almost equal those of working households, a radical change from the mid-1990s, when the elderly were far poorer than others.\n\nTheir health is also much improved. Better diagnosis and treatment of mental illness, in particular, has helped, since around 90% of suicides involve disorders like depression. Doctors have got better at spotting dementia, which can make people suicidal. And better painkillers mean chronic conditions such as arthritis are less debilitating, and therefore less of a strain on mental health.

On October 2nd he visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to collect some paperwork. Feeling unsafe, he asked his fiancée to wait outside and to call a member of Turkey’s ruling party if he did not emerge. He hasn't been seen since. Acquaintances feared he had been detained inside or abducted and flown back to Saudi Arabia against his will. Turkish police now believe he may have been murdered on the premises.\nIt is no mystery why Saudi Arabia might have wanted to silence Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the powerful crown prince, Muhammad bin Salman. He wrote frequently in Arabic, penned a regular column for the Washington Post, and kept close ties with countless diplomats and journalists. For over a year he used that platform to criticise growing repression in Saudi Arabia and urge an end to the war in Yemen. But he was hardly a radical. Mr Khashoggi was part of the Saudi elite, close to members of the royal family. In the 2000s he advised Turki al-Faisal, a former spy chief who became Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Britain and America. He often stressed that his criticism was nasiha, friendly counsel, and not a rejection of the monarchy.\nImage captured from CCTV video obtained by Hurriyet, a Turkish newspaper, and released on October 9th 2018 as Turkish officials announced that the Saudi Consulate will be searched as part of an investigation into Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. Credit: CCTV/Hurriyet via AP #Istanbul #Turkey #JamalKhashoggi #journalism #SaudiArabia", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/feec939430cfde2a7c088dbdc56a2ca6/5E5070BE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c164.0.751.751a/s640x640/42165286_702443676781251_2750826126430672060_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bos0MzlBIgJ/", "caption": "A dog poses next to a placard during the \"Wooferendum\" march in London on October 7th 2018.

Her crime: using a fork to eat. At the time, people generally cut up food with knives and transferred it to their mouths with their fingers. Forks did exist, but they were large, two-pronged implements used for toasting or carving meat. Maria, however, used one of these to put food in her mouth. Her wayward behaviour was immediately condemned by the clergy. When Maria died of the plague two years later, it was seen as divine punishment for her decadence. Yet today we would look down on anyone who didn’t use a fork.

Victims of harassment in workplaces of all sorts, from S&P 500 companies to small-and medium-sized firms to startups, have come forward in unprecedented numbers to share their harrowing experiences. Customers, investors, boards, employees, stock analysts and even insurers increasingly ask for information on what a company does for women, including the protection it affords against harassment. Equileap, which ranks firms on gender-equality criteria, now includes sexual-harassment policies. It is seeing strong demand for such data.

Yet in the time that #MeToo has been trending the number of female Fortune 500 CEOs has fallen. Progress in closing the pay gap has stalled in several rich countries.

There is certainly plenty of both on display in “Magic Realism: Art in Weimar Germany 1919-33”, a new exhibition at Tate Modern in London. But rather than presenting the Weimar Republic as a brief, ill-fated interlude born of one set of horrors and foreshadowing another, the organisers of the exhibition have selected artworks that give a more nuanced impression of the era. This painting by Rudolf Schlichter of his wife, Speedy (a name she preferred to her given one, Elfriede), portrays her with intense, detailed realism, yet the background – the strange, twisted landscape, the moon and ominous sky – give it the other-worldly atmosphere of a science-fiction book cover.

Her murder appeared to be the melodramatic climax of the most persistent theme in her often controversial reporting. Malta is often held up as one of the European Union’s successes – since 2011, the Catholic country has legalised divorce and same-sex marriage – but Caruana Galizia believed that these liberal gestures masked a darker and more troubling reality. At different times she described the island as a “nest of thieves”, a “den of crooks” and a “slew of ineptitude, violence and corruption”. In the aftermath of the bomb, two questions lingered like smoke. Who was making her death into a statement? And what were they saying?

As a married mother-of-three and a teacher at a Jesuit high school in Amiens, she fell for a pupil in her drama class who was 24 years her junior. Despite the obstacles to their romance, they eventually married – and he ended up the president of France. Their improbable relationship prompted family censure, popular unease and malicious rumours. But the most unexpected twist in Brigitte Macron’s story is her current popularity in France: at the age of 65, she is forcing the French to question what it means to be a woman and, in particular, a woman of her age.

At a café called Las Violetas in northern Buenos Aires in the late 1970s and early 1980s they regularly sat with their matés and medialunas, chatting. On Thursdays, in white headscarves, they would go to the centre of the city and walk round the Plaza de Mayo, in front of the presidential palace, joining the Mothers there to ask what had happened to the thousands who had been “disappeared” by the military regime. On other days, Las Violetas was their secret plotting place.\n\nBefore long, photos of grandchildren might come out. Chicha shared hers proudly: dear little Clara Anahí, with her lively dark eyes and lots of flyaway first chestnut hair, always smiling. But there were no photos of her older than three months, for on November 24th 1976 she had disappeared in a military raid.\n\nChicha had been at home that day in La Plata, not as usual teaching art history in secondary school. She was sewing a bathrobe for Clara Anahí, worrying about the rash she had after her measles injection, when she heard tanks go down the road. Their purpose, it turned out, was to destroy the house where her son Daniel, his wife Diana and a few companions, all Montoneros violently opposed to the regime, were printing a newspaper. She knew nothing of politics, but heard the explosions. Everyone was killed, apart from Daniel. The army murdered him later, her studious economist son; and the only thing that kept her living then was the thought that Clara Anahí had survived.\n\nShe was sure of it. The baby had been pulled from under her mother’s body, or found hidden under towels in a bath. She had been handed to some officer. These were the whispers. And she was then given, as all such babies were, to some “properly Argentinian” couple, instead of to her grandmother, as she should have been.\n\nFor the full article search \"Hope against hope\" or in the Obituary section at economist.com Credit: Facebook/Maria Isabel Chorobik #Argentina", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f52e399ee1139d668a55cc48e6f51ece/5E59E5FD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c55.0.969.969a/s640x640/41079252_237519353589971_1970331805400911920_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BngaaVQBaQT/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c9cd61415fc7fcd5247f2b36b49ed3f8/5DC2216D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/39687811_2039397359705180_4324458965518442629_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnf-ddGB8ij/", "caption": "From @1843mag: A garlicky fermented cabbage dish with an aroma like wet socks may not sound too appetising, but most Koreans are crazy about kimchi.

The prudish wording of India’s colonial-era penal code of 1860 has long cast a baleful shadow over gay people. Section 377 banned “carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal”. This was taken to bar homosexual intercourse along with bestiality and incest. Even heterosexuals could be prosecuted for enjoying oral or anal sex. The ban on gay sex was struck down by a Delhi court in 2009. It was then reinstated by the Supreme Court in 2013, which said parliament should deal with the matter. However, on September 6th the court reversed itself. A broader bench ruled, to general applause from Indian liberals, that the law does not, after all, criminalise homosexuality. The decision is final. The chief justice, Dipak Misra, called the ban on gay sex “irrational, indefensible and manifestly arbitrary”. At issue was the meaning of “the order of nature”. One judge, Indu Malhotra, said that being gay should be understood as a “variation”, not an “aberration”, of human nature. For the full story search \"India unbans gay sex\" at economist.com.

As the fighting has driven people from their homes in Homs, the suburbs of Damascus and Aleppo, they have been funnelled into Idlib. Now they have nowhere to go. It is expected that within weeks the Syrian regime and its Russian backers may launch one of the biggest battles of the war, to crush the rebels and regain control of this pocket of resistance on the border with Turkey. Government victory in Idlib would spell the end of the armed rebellion against Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad. Photo shows rebel soldiers in Idlib province on September 3rd 2018.

One solution was to develop a new set of mechanisms to classify and retrieve information: the scholarly journal.

Since our last update many high-profile names within the film industry have joined calls for his release. A group of Czech filmmakers announced a rotating fast in a show of solidarity over the next five days, including Václav Kadrnka, Zuzana Kříhová, Eva Papoušková, Radim Špaček and Roman Vávra. On August 15th more than 100 other international filmmakers and artists wrote an open letter, published in Le Monde, a French newspaper. They included Ken Loach, a British director, Margarethe von Trotta, a German director and actress and Jean-Luc Godard, a Swiss-French filmmaker.\n\nMr Sentsov was arrested at his home in Crimea in 2014 by members of Russia's Federal Security Service. At his trial the prosecution failed to prove any link to \"terrorist acts\" and the key prosecution witness stated in court that he had given his testimony under duress. Instead of the trial collapsing, Mr Sentsov was given a 20-year sentence in a Siberian penal colony. He has survived on water and nutrients supplied via intravenous drip. In 2014 Russia was suspended from membership of the G8 over its invasion and annexation of Crimea.

Those with more geographically dispersed social networks tend to be richer, more educated and healthier. These findings may prove valuable to policymakers. In their analysis of the relationship between social-media connections and trade, the authors note that each ten percentage-point increase in a state’s social connectedness to a foreign country is associated with 4.7% more imports from that country, and 6% more exports.

It was so fierce and sudden in the wooden house in Himbi, outside Goma, in eastern Congo, that Luc Nkulula could not get through the lounge to the main door. Nor could he climb out of his bedroom window, which was barred against thieves. He managed to stuff his laptop and some papers through, the most important things. Then the blazing curtain fell on his back, and he could not fight it off. His sister Amen, coming in from the outside privy, heard a noise like an explosion and saw him burning. After an hour, firemen came; by then, the house was ashes. Investigations by a state procurator blamed an overheated battery, but Mr Nkulula’s friends were sure he had been killed by the government in Kinshasa. \nTo read the full obituary search \"Under the volcano\" on economist.com Credit: KEYTv/YouTube #LucNkulula #Congo #obituary #Lucha", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7f21d3eec66476cefb68941485509c36/5E5FE5C2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/38096795_2142925742444463_2816168274545344512_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BmY9IwtBa_V/", "caption": "From @1843mag: Six years ago scientists in laboratories on either side of the Atlantic worked out how to edit the code of life – to tweak the information that makes our eyes green, muscles strong or IQs high.

Ms Peckre watched red-fronted lemurs in Madagascar gnawing on benzoquinone-rich millipedes and rubbing the remains around their anuses, then swallowing them. Human beings, who are frequent hosts of threadworms, can deal with them using drugs such as benzimidazole, which are similar in structure to benzoquinone. Ms Peckre therefore suspects that her lemurs are employing millipedes in lieu of a trip to the pharmacy. Photo of red-fronted lemurs, Madagascar.

Next thing he knew, it was 2003 and he was in Iraq, following the invading American army towards Baghdad as part of a bomb-disposal squad. Fifteen years on, he writes about the ludicrous yet oddly inspirational Americans soldiers he met, the tedium of waiting for something to happen – and the sinking feeling of having one's porn mags confiscated.

One is common to all levies: it raises money for the government. The second is that its use inflicts costs on third parties that are not factored into its price. The third is to discourage the use of undesirable products. Critics of such taxes have argued that they are ineffective because the goods they target tend to be addictive, making consumers relatively unresponsive to changes in price. In fact, study after study has shown that sin taxes do tend to reduce consumption. However, the people who are put off by higher prices may well be those who drink alcohol or fizzy drinks only sparingly and are not obese.

Yet he still drafts his novels in the same way: in his head. For Krasznahorkai, the whirls and eddies of language capture the reality of human thought and emotion. The snappy, short sentences we’re more used to reading in modern fiction are “artificial”, he says.

According to Amnesty International members of the FSB, Russia's Federal Security Service, put a plastic bag over his head and suffocated him until he passed out before removing him and transporting him to Russia for trial. They threatened him with rape and murder to force him to “confess” to organising “terrorist acts”. Mr Sentsov has always maintained his innocence. No single piece of evidence was presented to the court to prove Mr Sentsov’s personal involvement. The case against him should have collapsed when the key prosecution witness stated in court that he had testified against Mr Sentsov under duress. Instead Mr Sentsov received a 20-year prison sentence, being served in Siberia. His lawyer told the Associated Press that Mr Sentsov is receiving nutrients intravenously and drinking water. He is very weak and has lost more than 20kgs (44lbs) in weight. Russia was suspended from membership of the G8 over its invasion and annexation of Crimea.

Emmerson Mnangagwa, who became president after November’s coup, is expecting victory. His strongest challenger is Nelson Chamisa, leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. There are concerns over army interference, a voter roll including dead people and a ballot paper conveniently placing Mr Mnangagwa at the top. \nIn Pakistan's general election, the prime-minister-elect’s victory this week was, some suspect, eased by the military’s invisible hand.

When we follow our own thoughts too closely, we can lose our bearings, as our inner chatter drowns out common sense. A study of shopping behaviour found that the less information people were given about a brand of jam, the better the choice they made. When offered details of ingredients, they got befuddled by their options and ended up choosing a jam they didn’t like. The psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer argues that to make good decisions in a complex world, you have to be skilled at ignoring information. This is because much of our behaviour is based on deceptively sophisticated rules-of-thumb, or “heuristics”.

In the early 19th century, the tin mines in Cornwall, the county on England’s rugged southwestern tip, fell into decline. Many miners crossed the Atlantic in search of work. They had an especially warm welcome in Mexico, whose war of independence from Spain (1810-1821) had left its infrastructure battered and its mines flooded. Trekking 250 miles through swamps, thicket and rainforests, hundreds of Cornish miners settled around the silver mines of Real del Monte, a mountainous town in the state of Hidalgo in central Mexico. They brought the tools and expertise needed to dig for treasure, as well as a treasure of their own: a half-moon-shaped pocket pie with a meat and vegetable filling.

Of the 350,000 people who once lived in Yarmouk, only a few hundred remain. In 2015 the jihadists of Islamic State (IS) took control of most of Yarmouk. Jabhat al-Nusra, an erstwhile al-Qaeda affiliate, grabbed the rest. When the regime was not fighting them, they battled each other. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, has remained neutral during Syria’s war and some Palestinian groups even fought with the regime on the camp’s frontlines.

Each contains a layer of phosphorus and is pumped with neon or argon gas that lights up when electric current passes through it. To bend the rods, Wu heats them just to the point of pliability, a delicate procedure because the glass will shatter if it gets too hot. In its heyday, neon-lit Hong Kong literally outshone communist China. But the industry had dwindled by the turn of the century because of competition from the mainland and the introduction of cheaper LED lighting. Gentrification has also played a part in the decline: as neighbourhoods become more upmarket, old buildings are torn down and, with them, their neon signs. Wu Chi-kai is one of the few remaining neon artists. Click on 1843’s handle and follow the link in their bio to read more.

It was one of just five frames she took at the stage door of the Royal Court theatre as Beckett was trying to avoid her. Bown was unusual in that she preferred to dispense with the usual tricks of her trade – the lights and reflectors and darkroom shimmies – relying instead on her eye and her ability to melt into the background. She shot on 35mm film, almost always in black and white, and rarely took more than 10 minutes on an assignment – sometimes less. She was also one of the best portrait photographers of her time – Lord Snowdon described her as “a kind of English [Henri] Cartier-Bresson”.

Often they come from a time before air conditioning, which instigated the porch’s post-war decline. Cars hurt, too: they meant more fumes and less foot traffic, so fewer passers-by and impromptu hellos. Television drew people inside, to follow distant, fictional narratives instead of the micro-theatre of the pavement. People began to prefer backyard decks to streetside exposure. They became too busy to loiter in the evening; the aspiration to unbounded leisure that the porch represents increasingly seemed too remote to pursue. But the porch didn’t die and, in many new developments, it is being revived, as homeowners flee the forces that threatened it in the first place – all those inauthentic electronic connections and overburdened working lives.

In the Americas and Europe, ahead of the NATO summit in Brussels on July 11th and 12th, we look at the growing transatlantic rift. America did as much as any country to create post-war Europe. The alliance it fostered won the cold war and then built democracy in newly liberated eastern Europe. But tensions—over NATO contributions, divergent priorities and values and, lately, the demands of Donald Trump—are tearing it apart. That should worry Europe, America and the wider world.\n\nIn Asia, the Middle East and Africa we report on the plight of women in India. They are less likely to work there than in any G20 country except Saudi Arabia. And their exclusion is getting worse. Since 2005, India’s economy has doubled and the number of working-age women has doubled, yet 10m fewer women have jobs. The economic cost is immense—if Indian women were able to work as Indian men do, the country would be on the way to middle-income status.

A common saying in El Salvador is that the only way to quit a gang is in a body bag. But Pentecostalist churches are trying to offer a way out alive. In 2009 a prisoner named Nilson Bonilla announced that God had chosen him to be pastor of a new congregation called the Last Trumpet, and he convinced six other prisoners to join him. The movement has since mushroomed. Though without structural changes, the gang troubles in El Salvador are unlikely to disappear.

Along with other diamonds in the rough, the Melnikov House, one of Moscow’s most famous constructivist landmarks, is being restored. Built during the late 1920s, the house served as a private residence for Konstantin Melnikov, an architect who later fell foul of the Stalinist regime and in 1937 was banned from practising. Composed of two intersecting cylinders, the rounded walls feature a constellation of hexagonal windows that spread light through the building at all times of day. A wide spiral staircase runs through the centre of the home, stretching from the low first floor through a spacious living room and up to a dreamy studio space.

Since we last posted an update Mr Sentsov, an ethnically Russian-Ukrainian citizen, has continued to refuse food and demand the release of all 64 Ukrainian political prisoners from Russian jails. Today marks the 47th day he has gone without food. Mr Sentsov was born in Crimea and considered it to be part of the Ukrainian state that emerged from the Soviet collapse in 1991. (Nearly every country apart from Russia shares this view.) He was in Crimea in 2014 when Russian soldiers in plain uniform staged a coup there, an action for which Russia was suspended from the G8 group of nations. Oleg Sentsov attended a protest against the annexation and helped deliver food to besieged Ukrainian soldiers. He was seized by Russian security services and taken to Russia where he was charged with “terrorism”. In 2015 he received a 20-year sentence for supposedly plotting to blow up a statue of Lenin and set fire to a door in the Crimean office of Russia’s ruling party. Lenin’s statue was not blown up, and no one was injured in the fire. Mr Sentsov was innocent—the main witness said he had been forced to give false testimony, and withdrew his statement in court. Ukrainian residents demonstrate in support of Mr Sentsov on June 23rd 2018 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

His cycle of history paintings, “The Course of Empire”, depicts the rise of a civilisation from hunter-gatherers to agriculturalists to urbanites and its sudden and dramatic collapse. In an echo of the decline of the Roman empire, power has made the people in this painting, the third in the series, prosperous but also decadent – unwitting agents in their imminent demise. Implicit here was a critique of America’s emerging capitalist class and the European empires. To see the other paintings in Cole’s series, click on 1843’s handle and follow the link in their bio.

The peninsula is where 90% of global production takes place and where most of it is drunk. But that may be about to change.

Yet by 2017 only 2% of people carried the worm, and there had been no new cases recorded of people going blind from onchocerciasis in a decade. Elimination is expected by about 2022. Swipe through the maps to see this dramatic decrease. But how has Sierra Leone achieved this? Each year it provides drugs for four major diseases to everyone at risk.

Overall, the study finds that 14% of jobs across 32 countries are highly vulnerable, defined as having at least a 70% chance of automation. A further 32% were slightly less imperilled, with a probability between 50% and 70%. At current employment rates, that puts 210m jobs at risk across the 32 countries.

Twenty thousand years later a second eruption contorted the caldera to give it its current shape: it is 15km across at its widest and extends beneath parts of Naples and under the Bay of Pozzuoli.

Courtesans would tattoo the names of their preferred clients on their upper arms, followed by the word \"inochi\" – life – with the last stroke of the word elongated to convey eternal devotion. Their clients sometimes followed suit. In this print by Kitagawa Utamaro I (c. 1798-99), a courtesan named Azamino tattooes her name onto the arm of her lover Gontarō. Woodblock prints like this one let us track the history of tattooing in Japan.

The dispute has inspired a legal battle between the villagers and the mummy's new owner, Dutch art collector Oscar Van Overeem. Here, the statue enters an MRI scanner at a hospital in Amsterdam, so that Van Overeem can examine the mummy hidden within its casing.

It spread throughout southern Africa, evolving as it went. In northern Mozambique, coconut plays a strong role. In the south, lemon and garlic are more dominant.

They have come armed with assault rifles, their herds in tow; they have burned buildings, shot people and fought with police. There is a colonial tinge to the conflict: the conservation business here is largely white. But this fight is not a remnant of the age of empire. It is brilliantly, terrifyingly modern – a test of whether weak states can stand up to climate change, population growth and ethnic populism.

Snapchat allows for capering in the office without disturbing colleagues. Facebook and Instagram encourage pride in one’s achievements that might otherwise appear unseemly.

They also found that the least attractive pattern of stripes was precisely those of the sort of width found on zebra hides. Zebra stripes do, therefore, seem to repel insects. Exactly why is unclear but it might be related to the insect's ability to see polarised light, which imposes a sense of horizontal and vertical on an image.
