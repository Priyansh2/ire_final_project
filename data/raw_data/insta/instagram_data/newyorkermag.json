The claim dates to the 1983-84 academic school year, when Kavanaugh was a freshman at Yale University. The woman at the center of the story, Deborah Ramirez, who is fifty-three, attended Yale with Kavanaugh, where she studied sociology and psychology. Ramirez said that witnessing the attempts to discredit Christine Blasey Ford had made her frightened to share her own story, which she knew would be attacked due to the gaps in her memory and her level of inebriation at the time. “I’m afraid how this will all come back on me,” she said. In a statement, Kavanaugh denied the allegation. Click the link in our bio to read the story.

Now I'm back, responding to a similar urge to return to a place that is both familiar and now foreign to me. Every so often\nover the years I have come home to visit my mother and my friends and usually that has meant dealing with memories that I try to avoid and a city I have tried to forget. I am a foreigner here - and everywhere else it seems - a persistent expatriate and a shifting composite of the people I've lived with and and the places I've lived in.

I’m Ivan Kashinsky @ivankphoto. I live in a neighborhood called #Rumihuaico in a valley about thirty minutes outside of #Quito, #Ecuador.  This week I’ll be hosting the New Yorker instagram feed with photos from an ongoing project called #projectmibarrio.  This story is about change.  It’s about the mixture of past, present, and future. Not so long ago, this valley, which sits right bellow Quito, was just vast farmland.  In recent years there has been a population explosion, leading to super highways and shopping malls.  Despite the exponential growth and the rise of fast-food joints and global pop culture, parts of this area maintain the qualities of a small Ecuadorian pueblo.  Rumihuaico, #Tumbaco, and the rest of the neighborhoods in this valley are the perfect example of the old vs. new, chicha (a Pre-Columbian corn drink) vs. Coca-Cola Zero, or cockfights vs. movie theaters.  It is a fusion of the old generation and the new generation, a chaotic mixture, which I am a part of.  I hope you enjoy the ride.

Reading this every night trying to get some background. Harness racing is really different from thoroughbred racing for a bunch of reasons beside the cart they pull. The horses race in gait, either trotting, (their feet move diagonally,) or pacing, (the feet on each side go diagonally.) It's also much more small time, its easier for folks to be involved in it without being millionaires. It's the kind of business where a small time trainer like Dick Taylor can run a small farm, breed carefully, and with some smarts and luck come up with a handful of champions over the years. \nVictor J.

This is a picture of Alley, age 8, with Trigger, her entry in the model horse competition.\n\nAbout me: I'm a news and documentary photographer based (until recently) in Washington, DC, and a co-founder of the photography collective Prime. #webstercity #iowa #countyfair #primecollective", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/54b86fbdab8c5736078c5b7a83641249/5E49C10C/t51.2885-15/e15/924618_1560933960822356_1265124815_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/b9ywI_IQiq/", "caption": "Mark Thomas (left) and Guy Shorrock keep watch on Britain’s egg obsessives.

This is my setnet skiff. It's a 22 ft boat designed to catch and haul up to 6500 lbs of wild sockeye salmon in one load. We hope to max out at least a few times this year. The beauty of the Bristol Bay fleet is that there are thousands of small family run businesses rather then large corporate owned fishing enterprises. We fish two persons to a skiff, and haul our nets by hand. Next, a trip down the Naknek River, then a day of loading and packing. We will shove off Saturday or Sunday morn, and that's where this story will end.

The January 25 commemoration of the Egyptian uprising's beginning and death sentences for 21 accused in last year's Port Said soccer stadium massacre have sparked more conflict in Cairo, Port Said, and in other Egyptian cities.
