But the utility played a part in propping up climate change denial in the early, pivotal days when the public first learned of the threat.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nPG&E helped to sow confusion around climate change as an early member of the Global Climate Coalition, which led the successful campaign to stall regulation of greenhouse gas pollution. Working from 1989 to 2002, the Global Climate Coalition represented coal, oil, automakers, manufacturers, and utilities that all had a stake in maintaining the status quo.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nThe broader utility sector‚Äôs work in promoting skepticism around climate change continued, often through the trade group Edison Electric Institute that represents investor-owned utilities.

She had to share a room with several people, and the beds and food were similar to those in prison. ‚ÄúJust pretty much a step over incarceration,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúStill walking around with fear.‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Å†\nThat changed when she met Sabina Crocette, a lawyer who was working at a prisoner-rights nonprofit. They started hanging out, and when Croudy asked Crocette if she knew anyone with an extra room to rent, Crocette remembered a new pilot program she‚Äôd heard about: the Homecoming Project, which pays people with a spare room to house those returning to the community after long prison sentences.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nCrocette had previously taken in formerly incarcerated people with mixed results, but she‚Äôd connected with Croudy and wanted to try it again. About two months later, Croudy moved in.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nCroudy tears up remembering the first time she saw her new bedroom in Crocette‚Äôs West Oakland townhouse. Croudy assumed she‚Äôd basically be sleeping on the floor, but after she saw the queen-size bed and dresser dotted with fake candles, ‚Äúthis peace just came over me,‚Äù she says.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nFew formerly incarcerated people land in such welcoming accommodations, particularly in the Bay Area‚Äôs absurdly overpriced housing market. In Alameda County, where the Homecoming Project operates, 4,800 people returned from state prisons in 2014.

Aimee Stephens, a trans woman from Michigan, was fired from her job at a funeral home after she informed her boss that she was transitioning and intended to begin dressing according to the company‚Äôs dress code for women. The other two cases, from New York and Georgia, involve gay men who were dismissed after coming out.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nThe ACLU and other advocacy groups are arguing that gay and trans people are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which says employers aren‚Äôt allowed to discriminate on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, or religion. Sexuality and gender identity discrimination, the lawyers say, is a form of sex discrimination. Tuesday‚Äôs oral arguments mark the first time the Court has considered this question.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nIf the court agrees that orientation and gender identity fall under Title VII, all workers, both public and private, would be protected from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination. A ruling in the other direction wouldn‚Äôt overturn state employment protection laws, but it could open the door to state-level attacks on LGBTQ people in the workplace.‚Å†\n‚Å†\n‚ÄúThe Trump administration has indicated that it plans to really roll back protections, especially for trans people,‚Äù said Gabriel Arkles, who is on the ACLU team representing Stephens. ‚ÄúAnd so if the Supreme Court rules the wrong way here, then it would really green light that.‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Å†\nAdvocates note that the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling, which is not expected until 2020, might not directly affect most state laws, but could be significant in terms of legal precedent.

Sometimes texting a string of emojis to a friend can be a means of commiserating, acknowledging the friend‚Äôs message, or simply experiencing a sort of virtual togetherness.

And his first step for combatting bigotry and hatred: dispensing of the term ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not racist.‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Å†\n‚ÄúThe term ‚Äònot racist‚Äô has been a term of denial,‚Äù Kendi tells host @jamilahking in the latest episode of the Mother Jones podcast. ‚ÄúHow can we be antiracist if we are so convinced that we‚Äôre ‚Äònot racist,‚Äô when to be ‚Äònot racist‚Äô is to fundamentally be in denial of our own racism?‚Äù‚Å†\n‚Å†\nAccording to Kendi, it‚Äôs time to start accepting our own racism so that we can begin working to erase it‚Äîjust as he himself is doing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm striving each day to be an antiracist, to see the racial groups as equals, to support policies that lead to racial equity,‚Äù he says.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nClick the link in our bio to listen.‚Å†\n‚Å†\n(üì∏: Gabriele Holtermann-Gorden/Zuma)‚Å†", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/cbd3ff37f615a3e6a14ad4c7650c6ea0/5E47696D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69565599_172146853913266_5461677730756461755_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3CfUgTguWI/", "caption": "Medical debt burdens millions of Americans.

Now, the rule is being as a weapon in a new nativist backlash against Latinos.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nBut immigrants applying for green cards, which provide permanent legal status and a path to citizenship, are already barred from receiving most government assistance.

But you know what kinda does? Gamers.\n\nIn the wake of consecutive mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, GOP politicians went rummaging through the dated bargain bin of excuses for gun violence and latched on to a familiar find: video games. ‚ÄúWe must stop the glorification of violence in our society. This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace,‚Äù Trump said on Monday morning in remarks about the shootings. His words came just one day after Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) voiced similar concerns, saying, ‚ÄúThe idea of these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game of shooting individuals and others‚ÄîI‚Äôve always felt that is a problem.‚Äù The idea that video games might be a substantial driver of violence has been pushed at least since the Columbine shootings in 1999. It‚Äôs also been debunked since then. Other countries with large video game markets like Japan and China don‚Äôt have mass shooting or gun violence rates anywhere close to those in the United States.\n\nWhile McCarthy and Trump are wrong about the link between video games and guns, recent years have shown there is a link between some parts of video game culture and extremist violence. The 8chan imageboard, where multiple recent attackers have spread word of their actions, was born out of #Gamergate, an extensive online culture war that started in 2014, featuring vicious harassment campaigns targeting women in the gaming industry.\n\nGaming culture as a whole does not, of course, advocate mass shootings, nor is it necessarily extremist. Marginalized groups and individuals have found welcoming, helpful, and supportive pockets across video gaming, and there is a wealth of healthy and inclusive communities that don‚Äôt support white nationalism or reactionary politics.\n\nWhitney Phillips, who researches online extremism at Syracuse University, told Mother Jones that targeting gaming culture as the source of white supremacist shootings is about as misguided as blaming the video games themselves.

In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the ACA on the grounds that the individual mandate counted as a tax.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nIn December, a district court judge in Texas sided with the Republicans and struck down all parts of Obamacare, everything from the law‚Äôs provision expanding Medicaid, to subsidies for middle-class families to buy insurance on the marketplaces, to mandates for calorie counts on menus‚Äînot just the individual mandate. If the Texas decision stands, 19.9 million more people in the US would be uninsured, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute.‚Å†\n‚Å†\nThe Trump administration has sided with the GOP attorneys general in the case.

How do media narratives influence the way we think about women and power?\n\nJoin an extraordinary panel, moderated by Mother Jones' Jamilah King, as we discuss the challenges‚Äîand hope‚Äîof achieving a more equal conversation.\n\nPanelists:\n‚Ä¢ Samhita Mukhopadhyay, executive editor, Teen Vogue\n‚Ä¢ Antonia Hylton, politics correspondent and producer, Vice\n‚Ä¢ Kat Aaron, producer, Pineapple Media\n‚Ä¢ Imara Jones, creator and host, The Last Sip on Free Speech TV\n\nThursday, April 11, 2019 at 7pm\nTishman Auditorium\n63 5th Avenue, New York, NY\n\nClick the link in our bio to get tickets!", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4e8689de0218da092c3b8bd67c9384af/5E3E17B5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/52464627_473345236531991_9113893970552597264_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BupgJMhDVzy/", "caption": "On Saturday, Trump appeared in front of a crowd of adoring right-wing activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference to deliver a rambling, largely ad-libbed speech that stretched over two hours.

The bill also garnered support from Donald Trump, who made the death penalty for cop killers a cornerstone of his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nClick the link in our bio to read more about O'Rourke's voting history, and what it might mean if he were to join the ever-growing 2020 presidential race.\n(üì∏: Mario Cantu/CSM via ZUMA Wire)\n#beto #news #politics #blacklivesmatter", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/548f07a36a90d026bc0c8f03b9834b2b/5E5B26BF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/49590862_110923633333974_3189772419497704717_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs3VDfngL9k/", "caption": "On Saturday, thousands gathered across the country for the third annual Women‚Äôs March.

One of the most prominent voices to emerge from that era was that of DeRay Mckesson.\n\nAn educator by trade, he famously ditched his day job and drove several hours from Minnesota to Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 after the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, Jr., an unarmed 18-year-old black man. As Ferguson‚Äôs mostly black residents rose up in protest over the killing, Mckesson, along with a swell of black activists and journalists, joined them and took to the streets. Since then, that ecosystem of black activists has gone on to advocate for systemic change in a myriad of ways. Mckesson‚Äôs high-profile approach has included running for mayor of Baltimore, his hometown.\n\nMore recently, he published a book called ‚ÄúOn the Other Side of Freedom: The Case for Hope,‚Äù in which he tells stories from the frontlines of activism and gives a stirring account of how his identity as a black, gay man in America prepared him for one of the most contentious moments in recent American history.

The ads targeted adults aged 35 to 64 and aired on local news programs and syndicated shows like \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune;\" adults that Red Eagle had described as ‚Äúanti-Hillary‚Äù and ‚Äúpro-Trump.‚Äù The Trump campaign pursued a strikingly similar advertising strategy. Shortly after the Red Eagle purchase, as Election Day loomed, it bought 33 ads on the same station, set to air during the same week. Red Eagle and the firm Trump's campaign hired to buy the ads appear at first glance to be separate. The issue, however, is that each firm is closely connected to a major conservative media-consulting firm called National Media Research, Planning and Placement.

As of Monday, the President announced that he had heard the protesters message and is set to release new details of an economic plan in response on Tuesday, which includes cuts to taxes on overtime pay and a raise in the national minimum wage.\n\nJulie Laurie has the full report.

According to the school‚Äôs ‚Äúunpaid lunch policy,‚Äù reported by ThinkProgress, students who do not have money for lunch can charge up to five hot meals.

His role as a swing voter has made him the court‚Äôs most powerful justice, with Supreme Court advocates tailoring oral arguments specifically to try to win his favor. Kennedy‚Äôs decision to retire gives Trump the opportunity to move the court farther to the right.

But the practice puts pressure on vulnerable asylum-seekers: Many detainees at Mesa Verde and other facilities in the Bay Area don't meet their pro bono lawyers and judges in person. Instead, they meet via video teleconference. The rise of trial-by-screen is a result of two factors: a massive spike in the number of immigrants in detention, begun under Obama and ramped up by Trump, and the increasingly remote locations of the facilities that house them. The downside to video teleconference? The detainees appearing via video give up more quickly and resign themselves to so-called self-deportation, according to a study conducted by Northwestern University Law Review.

He made this remark after being shown a chart that illustrated a steady decrease in the number of US nuclear weapons over the past 50 years. Trump responded by telling his most senior advisers, which included Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that he wanted the bigger number shown at the start of the downward slope, not the smaller amount at the end. Officials had to explain to Trump that the current level was lower due to years of successful arms treaties and that the nation‚Äôs overall military posture was now much stronger than in the days of a larger and bloated nuclear arsenal.

On the way, a 24 karat gold necklace was stolen from her; she had hoped to sell it as a way to fund her trip. The necklace came from Egypt, where she lived for a few years recently.

A bullet hissed through the window and struck Gutierrez through the jaw. It may have been from a nearby gang incident. When the police came, Gutierrez scribbled down that she had no idea who had pulled the trigger, or why. The case wasn't solved.\n\nShe spent the next month in the hospital undergoing multiple procedures, including surgeries to reconstruct her facial bones and install dentures. Medicaid covered most of the $120,000 in costs. Her hospital stay was followed by many months of physical therapy and counseling.\n\nGutierrez worked in retail before the shooting, but struggled to find a customer service job after the shooting. \"I felt like employers didn't want to hire me because the scars were so prevalent,\" she says. Her caseworker from Youth Alive, a local nonprofit that aids victims of violent crime, helped her relocate to a safer neighborhood and continue with counseling. Today, she works for the organization herself. She also attends nursing school.

A stray bullet pierced Wiriadjaja's chest and lodged in his stomach. At the hospital, Wiriadjaja was put into a coma, beginning what would be a two-week stay. Then, \"it took me seven months of physical therapy to regain most of my day-to-day functions, and about 18 months of psychiatric treatment to stave off PTSD,\" he says.\n\nPart of Wiriadjaja's response was to blog about his recovery, including a series of photos displaying his scars. His medical and mental-health treatments have totaled about $169,000, most of which have been covered by his health insurance. His deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses cost more than $20,000 eating up his savings. He was told that he was eligible for reimbursements from the state's office of victim services, but the process was so daunting on top of his recovery and return to work that he decided to move on.\n\nToday, Wiriadjaja is an assistant arts professor at New York University in Shanghai. \"I'm lucky, because I had savings, health insurance, and an incredible support network,\" he says. \"Many other gunshot survivors are not.

Earlier that evening, Dominic, 19, had handed her a gift for her birthday and told her he loved her. The next time she saw him, he was sprawled on the pavement at an intersection in East Oakland, surrounded by police cars.\n\nAfter the funeral, Brown says she felt deeply alone, despite her large family. She began a year of grief counseling through Catholic Charities of the East Bay. State and local government funds covered the costs, about $10,000. \"I could be anywhere and I could just cry,\" Brown says. \"It's an ongoing thing that you feel. I guess I'm going to feel it for the rest of my life.\" Brown called the Oakland Police Department every few months to check on the status of the case. In 2013, detectives told her that they'd identified a suspect in Dominic's murder, but that there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute without a witness stepping forward.

Bosley lost several thousand dollars in earnings during a six-month leave of absence from her job. She twice attempted suicide. \"I could be okay one hour, then the next minute I could look at something and be broken down,\" she says. In 2007, Bosley and her husband started a service to help gun violence survivors join support groups.
