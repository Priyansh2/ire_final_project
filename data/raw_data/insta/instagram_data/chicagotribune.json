Based in Tazewell County, southeast of Peoria, Trent Lawrence is one of about 475 Illinoisans who have received licenses to farm hemp since the state started accepting applications last month. ⠀\n⠀\nHemp, a cousin of the marijuana plant, is perhaps best known for its use in foods and fibers. But certain varieties of hemp produce cannabidiol, or CBD, the wildly popular cannabis compound that is being infused into everything from animal treats to teas and cosmetics. CBD, which does not get users high, has been touted as a cure for stress, inflammation, insomnia and any number of other ailments. ⠀\n⠀\nFarming hemp for CBD is much different than farming hemp for fiber or grain. From planting to harvesting, hemp that is raised for CBD must be tended to manually, while hemp raised for grain and fiber can be farmed with the same equipment that is used with other crops. If everything goes according to plan, Lawrence estimates he could make $100,000 per acre of CBD hemp. And it’s not just the potential profits. For corn and soybean farmers, hemp is also a means of diversifying away from the state’s two primary crops, the latter of which has been socked with tariffs. ⠀\n⠀\nDespite hemp’s finicky needs, farmers like Lawrence are depending on this year’s crop.

This isolated village, where history runs deep, is an oddity even during dry weather. ⠀\n⠀\nKaskaskia, the capital of Illinois from 1818 until 1820, has been severed from the rest of the state for more than 135 years, when the Mississippi River took the path of least resistance and cut a new route to the east, leaving the town stranded alone on the west side of the river. The once powerful epicenter of Illinois government has been even more isolated from the rest of the country since April, when floodwaters swamped the lone link to the island. Because most of the island’s 14,000 acres are surrounded by levees to protect it from the powerful flow of the Mississippi, the water has nowhere to go. ⠀\n⠀\n“The water can’t go anywhere because the river’s so high,” Chester Wingerter, the site superintendent for the state historic sites in and near Kaskaskia, said. “It’s not necessarily the river, it’s the rain water.” ⠀\n⠀\nResidents have been forced to choose between an elaborate and inconvenient system of transportation or seek temporary living options with friends and family. Those who have remained in their homes must plan ahead for groceries or medicine, since there is no store on the island, only a collection of homes, barns, workshops and the historic buildings of the village. ⠀\n⠀\nThe attraction of place — the farms passed down among generations, the memories and the uniqueness of the location — it’s all too strong for residents to leave behind.

Some Muslim women believe they are required to wear the hijab, while others do not. It can be a signal to others that you demand respect. The hijab can be a very American assertion of the right to self-expression. It can be flat-out feminist. ⠀\n⠀\n“It’s a big ‘screw you’ to beauty standards, you know?” said graduate student Naima Zaheer (photo3) of Oak Brook. “Sometimes we buy into the idea that we’re not enough, that we have to do a certain thing a certain way to be considered beautiful, and I feel like this is a way to say, ‘No, I’m just going to be who I am.‘” ⠀\n⠀\nWhile some women reported overwhelmingly positive reactions to their hijabs, others detailed negative encounters.

Learning from Colorado, Illinois lawmakers will probably limit home growers to five plants per person, possibly for medical patients only, state Sen. Heather Steans said. Medical marijuana became available in Illinois in 2015, but the law does not allow patients to grow it at home.\n\nIllinois lawmakers also plan to prohibit public consumption and private lounges in the state, which would preclude smoking on tour buses, and to ban butane hash oil except by licensed producers.

Our time here has been but a blink. In 2019, we must begin a new century with new maturity … and enough foolishness to believe we can make a difference. That starts with leadership that abandons single minded, arrogant notions. No. Everything is not broken.\" ⠀\n⠀\nDespite his billions, Pritzker tried to highlight middle class themes, repeating his call to raise the minimum wage, highlighting the work of teachers and trumpeting his proposal to tax wealthier Illinoisans at higher rates.

There are fewer priests. Less funds. Fewer people in the pews. In just a few decades, those identifying with the faith have dropped by hundreds of thousands. In 1975, the Chicago Archdiocese was home to 455 parishes. More than 40 years later, that number has shrunk by 24 percent. And further declines are likely. The declines have prompted the archdiocese to launch Renew My Church, a multiyear restructuring program that will force many parishes to consolidate with one another — or, in some cases, shut down altogether. ⠀\n⠀\n“When they close churches, they kill communities,” said Dominic Pacyga, a retired history professor who grew up in Back of the Yards attending Sacred Heart. ⠀\n⠀\nAs dioceses across America face backlash from sex abuse scandals — including recent revelations that the number of clergy accused of sex abuse in Illinois is much higher than previously disclosed — and adapt to an increasingly secular society, Chicago’s church leaders hope to reanimate and rebuild the city’s Catholic population. The data seem to point to a grim future for the church, but Betsy Bohlen, chief operating officer for the archdiocese, said Chicago’s Catholics have reason to hope. The current restructuring process, perhaps long overdue, aims to adapt the parochial system so it provides ample resources to minister to the Catholic faithful. ⠀\n⠀\nSt. Ita in Edgewater and St. Adalbert in Pilsen, pictured, will both be consolidating their parishes with other churches.

Crowe, a resident of the Greater Grand Crossing area, said her work, “Rest in Power, Rest in Peace,” is a “humanitarian, cathartic shrine experience for a city who needs it; a shrine for the dead and the living on the astral plane, the ‘in between’ or in another dimension.” The exhibit is made up of two rooms: one has a chair and many cowry shells; the other one, below, has a shrine with a golden glow. Visitors can write a note to someone they’ve lost or a hope for the future. ⠀\n⠀\nSansing, an Avalon Park native, put his stamp on 29Rooms via a mural on the warehouse space that holds the event.

Metra station for an hour-and-39-minute ride to Chicago — no small commitment for a high school junior. And that’s only half of his commute. Zachary lives on a small farm near Whitewater, Wis. He leaves home by 5:30 a.m. to arrive by 8:30 a.m. at The Chicago Academy for the Arts, where he takes a full load of college-preparatory classes and works toward his dream of becoming a professional ballet dancer. After school, he arrives home around 9 p.m., at which point he feeds the family’s seven goats and tends to his other farm chores. Homework is mostly done on the train. It’s a grueling schedule. ⠀\n⠀\nZachary doesn’t begrudge it for an instant. “My initial feeling when I came here was, ‘Oh my gosh. I fit in,’” he said. No distance is too far, most of us will attest, to find where you belong. ⠀\n⠀\nZachary began dancing at age 4. By middle school, his talent was undeniable. School, however, was torture. “I’m a dancer, and I’m bisexual,” he said. “Being a boy wearing tights isn’t really looked at as cool in a lot of places.” He considered giving up ballet altogether if it would make the bullying stop. Then, as an eighth grader, his mom brought him to a dance concert at The Academy. “After seeing them dance,” Zachary said, “I told my mom, ‘I need to be a part of that.’” And now he is.

They posted its 117 pages online this spring for help deciphering its contents. Some of its charms: ⠀\n⠀\nDoth ye a toothache? “Take a tooth out of a deadman’s skull and hange the same about the partie’s neck ...” ⠀\n⠀\nLost ye voice? “Dip 5 Sage leaves in mustard, lay them under his tong, closing his mouth agayn. This will cause him to speake ...” (Only do this, the spell warns, if the ailing soul is still alive.) ⠀\n⠀\nSince May, the book has been read on the library’s website more than 300,000 times and every page was transcribed and translated and many of the most active translators have been self-identified witches and warlocks.

There are two versions of French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s “Two Sisters (On The Terrace).” One has hung in the Art Institute of Chicago since 1933. The other is in President Donald Trump’s New York apartment. But one of them is a fake — and the Art Institute says it isn’t the one in Chicago. \nTrump, apparently, disagrees. Trump biographer Tim O’Brien — who was raised in Chicago and knew the painting well — told Vanity Fair’s “Inside the Hive” podcast that he first challenged Trump over the authenticity of Trump’s “Renoir” years ago on the real estate mogul’s private jet, where it once hung. Even after O’Brien pointed out that the real Renoir hangs in Chicago, Trump continued to insist his was real, telling him, “You know, that’s an original Renoir,” O’Brien said. And after Trump sold the jet, the “Renoir” apparently made its way to Trump Tower in New York, where it was visible in the background during an interview he gave “60 Minutes” after his 2016 election victory.\n“I’m sure he’s still telling people who come into the apartment, ‘It’s an original, it’s an original,’” O’Brien said on the podcast. “He believes his own lies in a way that lasts for decades,” O’Brien added. “He’ll tell the same stories time and time again, regardless of whether or not facts are right in front of his face.” Art Institute spokeswoman Amanda Hicks said the institute is “satisfied that our version is real.” The Renoir was gifted to the Art Institute in 1933 by Annie Swan Coburn, who purchased it for $100,000 from the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who purchased it from the artist in 1881, Hicks said.\nThe White House did not respond to questions about the provenance of Trump’s “Renoir.” @pvelasquez52 photo #renoir #twosisters #artinstituteofchicago #impressionism", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f7195993ae4dfd4265f4fba6401642ab/5E652C86/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.61.1080.1080a/s640x640/22580759_121427238537661_4442438197858795520_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Baaq1B_nWgM/", "caption": "Chicago Cubs right fielder Jon Jay, left, and second baseman Javier Baez celebrate after winning Game 4 of the National League Championship Series by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 at Wrigley Field in Chicago on Oct. 18, 2017.

He has fared well against the Dodgers on the series roster, who have hit .189 against him in 37 career at-bats. The bad news? One Dodger who has hit Hendricks relatively well, though it's a small sample size, is Justin Turner.

Turner also is the only one with more than one hit off the Cubs right-hander.

It set in a couple days after.”\nBut the magic of Bennett’s crowning was not lost in her composure.\nAfter a walk up and down the stage, donning her shining crown, another black contestant ran up to be the first to hug and congratulate Bennett. The exchange was an act of pure bliss and sisterhood.\n“There were very few black girls competing,” said Bennett. “We were all close friends and talked about how it had to be the year for one of us to take it.

A bullet pierced his back near the base of his spinal cord and ripped upward through his body. In the weeks afterward, it wasn't guaranteed he would live. He did. In the year since, he has endured eight surgeries, seen his face and his scars displayed all over the news, listened as his name became shorthand for the violence that threatens Chicago's children. He missed a lot of school and had to take night classes to catch up so he could be promoted to sixth grade. He goes to the doctor regularly to verify that his organs are healing. It still makes him mad that no one has been arrested for the shooting. Despite all that, Tuesday was a day that he and his relatives described with words like happy, joyful, grateful, blessing. ‘We could have been putting on T-shirts and sitting at the cemetery,’ said his mother, Mellanie Washington. ‘I'm still here,’ Tavon said.” @ejwamb photo", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b12fdb5b248eec0010655e059427c3a0/5E58E539/t51.2885-15/e35/c136.0.592.592a/20686535_792806697591213_1459781932765151232_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BXlV88dnaqV/", "caption": "A man walking in Chase Tower Plaza is reflected in a glass top covering Marc Chagall's mosaic, The Four Seasons at 10 S.

Jamela still bears the scar on her head from the port used to deliver medication. Jamela's mother, Tangela Watson, is thankful for it and that Medicaid, a state- and federally funded health insurance program, covered the costs of Jamela's care. But Watson does worry about how the Medicaid program might change if the Senate's Obamacare replacement bill becomes law. About 30 million children nationally and 1.5 million kids in Illinois rely on the program. Much of the debate over Obamacare's future in recent months has focused on skyrocketing health insurance prices, consumer choice and whether able-bodied adults should have access to Medicaid. The effect of replacement bills on children, however, hasn't received as much attention. Proponents of the latest proposal, the Senate's Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017, say it will help rein in federal spending on Medicaid while still protecting the nation's most medically needy children. Opponents, however, fear the bill, which would reduce projected Medicaid spending by an estimated $772 billion between 2017 and 2026, would disproportionately hurt children because they make up such a large part of the Medicaid population. Kids sometimes qualify for Medicaid even when their parents don't based on family income. Lurie plans to fly Watson and Jamela to Washington, D.C., this week, so Watson can talk at an advocacy event about what Medicaid has done for her family. \"It's very important that our voices be heard before they make these drastic decisions for our children,\" Watson said. \"At least they can hear us and see what we're saying, so they can hear our kids' stories.\" @malarchy photo #Chicago #ChicagoTribune #cancer #Obamacare #Medicaid", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/711ee778b3df6fd96c3b75a488592dbc/5E4295F6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/19984683_474709649533442_3293449659229405184_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BWafzJ4nqUa/", "caption": "Neighbors look on as Chicago firefighters take a break after battling a fire in a four story apartment building the the 3500 block of west Douglas Blvd. in Chicago Tuesday, July 11, 2017.

Rather, divisions of a New York-based private developer own and manage this complex that has become a symbol of the violence wracking the city. As far as Holmes is concerned, a lot of the problems stem from former residents and other guests who bring crime to the community. \"This community needs to take responsibility for itself,\" he said.

He eventually left the house after eating a warm meal she’d prepared him. “He couldn’t have been outside for more than half an hour when it happened.” Several gangs in Chicago have begun using rifles in recent shootings.

Chicago has seen the worst violence in decades this year, with more than 600 people killed and more than 3,000 shot. Blamed in part on gangs, access to guns, poverty and distrust of policing, the violence has seemed intractable. This past spring, officials launched a small pilot program they hope will get at one of the roots of that problem — changing attitudes toward violence. The program is called SAVE, for Sheriff's Anti-Violence Effort. Months into the effort, officials say it's too early to say whether it will live up to its name. The inmates, 18 to 24, live in an open dorm setting, away from the general jail tiers, and are in class or therapy six to eight hours a day. Most of them come from Chicago's most violent neighborhoods — Austin, Lawndale, Englewood — and many have been on the giving and receiving end of violence. They all are awaiting trial or sentencing for felonies. Photo by E.

His neighbor was killed there in August. As the numbers of shootings and killings skyrocket in Chicago, most of the violence has been driven by traditional gang conflicts on the South and West sides. But over the past two years, violence in developing and more affluent areas close to the Loop has also spiked, giving more Chicagoans a taste of the danger and fear that people in the city's poorer neighborhoods have experienced for decades. \"The capper was the murder of a guy walking on a Sunday morning at 10 o'clock,\" said Sudzus, a lawyer who lives down the block with his wife and two children.  Now, Sudzus has found himself at the center of an emerging community group, the South Loop Safety Association. While the group, and others like it, have put pressure on local political leaders to respond to the increase in crime, Sudzus said the group has really focused on opening lines of communication among residents about what's going on around them.

It  was a performance that the Chicago pianist never thought would happen. Sure, he had been studying Maurice Ravel's monumental Piano Concerto for the Left Hand for nearly 60 years.  But the days leading up to the big performance had been difficult. \"I started having a little panic attack. So I had to put that aside,\" he said. Wherever Malone went, he was followed by a crew from Chicago's Kartemquin Films, which is developing a documentary about Malone in association with the Tribune.  At age 5, he was a prodigious pianist growing up in a Chicago housing project. Tragically, when Malone was 10 his father attacked him and his two younger brothers as they slept, wielding a hammer to their heads, then took his own life. The boys survived, but each was partially paralyzed on the right side. Which meant Malone no longer would be able to play the piano. Or so everyone told him. But Malone refused to accept that verdict, spending years trying to find someone who would teach him to play the instrument with one hand — someone, anyone who knew there was a vast repertoire of piano music written for left hand alone.

John was sous-chef for Charlie Trotter for two years, then was sous-chef for Grant Achatz for the first two years of Alinea. Karen was pastry sous-chef under Gale Gand at Tru for two years before jumping to Trotter's for five, the last two as head pastry chef. When the Shieldses left Chicago in 2008, their collective resume was already impressive, even if name recognition was scant. Handed the opportunity to open Charlie Trotter's new restaurant in Las Vegas, the couple went in the opposite direction, heading to rural Chilhowie, Va., to open their own restaurant...Now the Shieldses — at this point very much known in the restaurant community, thank you very much — are back in Chicago with a triumphant restaurant that justifies every nice thing that's ever been said about them. At Smyth (pronounced \"smith,\" in case you were wondering), the Shieldses have achieved that very tricky balance between culinary excellence and unaffected informality.

In what was Archie's bedroom, a shrine of candles and keepsakes remains. Photos adorn the walls, including a selfie of his thick dreadlocks framing a handsome face with soulful eyes. Pickens typically avoids his bedroom, but on a recent afternoon she shared jokes and tears with her sister, Regina, as they gazed at the mementos. There was anger, too. The sister, who lives in the same apartment building, questioned why police hadn't solved the killing. Pickens, a home-health-care worker, said she has struggled providing help to dying patients because it brings back memories of her son's killing. She also said she no longer talks to people who don't seem to understand why she is still grieving.

Tucker, 33, learned last month that he'll lose his job in November when his employer, the Pattiki Mine in Carmi, Ill., shuts down permanently. He said when mines close, the aftershocks touch many more who indirectly depend on them. \"The number of jobs that will be lost or negatively affected will be hundreds, thousands,\" Tucker said. \"That's what people don't realize. It's just enormous what it'll do to southern Illinois.\" For more than a century coal has fueled the economy of this often-depressed region. Miners risk their bodies in labyrinthine tunnels and on mineral-rich hillsides, and in exchange, they can earn $80,000 or more — wages far beyond anything else available in the area. But this long-standing covenant could be reaching its end. Illinois mining companies have shed more than 1,200 jobs over the last year as strict new environmental regulations and cheap natural gas have encouraged utilities to drop their reliance on coal. Only about 2,800 jobs remain, the lowest tally in decades. Howard Learner  of Chicago's Environmental Law and Policy Center said regulations aren't the major reason for coal's decline. More relevant, he said, are bad business decisions: Some mining companies went on a buying spree believing that economic growth in China would continue at a breakneck pace, only to go bankrupt when that bet went sour. \"Those are real economic factors that are not likely to be affected by who is president,\" he said.

But McKinney, who now plays for #Chicago State, says he sometimes feels like an anomaly in the sport he adores. \"Being from the South Side of Chicago, baseball is just not a big sport,\" said McKinney, who is from Roseland. \"It's like being foreign on the South Side of Chicago.

The boxing program, called Boxing Out Negativity, is his restitution for the kids who followed in his misguided footsteps, who wound up dead or, like his brother, in prison. \"Home,\" to these kids, he said, \"is just a place you lay down. Their so­-called real family is on the corner.\" Brown joined the Vice Lords when he was 12, in the days when Chicago's gangs were highly structured. His gang ruled a swath of the West Side known as the Holy City. \"I was a child who had dreams and ambitions to become great,\" he said. He is 40 now. During the academic year, Brown runs his program out of William Penn Elementary School, but he keeps it going at home in the summer, the months when Chicago violence is especially volatile and kids, playing outside, are especially vulnerable. It feels to him, as it does to many others, that since Chicago's old-­style gang hierarchies have collapsed, violence continues to get more capricious. For these kids, he wants more. \"I want #intelligence. I want a future. I want a #calmness.\" Yes, he tells them, life is unfair. But take the unfairness and make the best out of it.

Four bicyclists have been killed so far this year — double what it was in 2015 for the same period but matching the average for 2010­2014, according to the Chicago Department of Transportation.

In less than half a century, Asian carp went from being unknown in U.S. waters to making up 90 percent of the biomass in some stretches of the Illinois and #Mississippi rivers. Bighead and silver carp were first introduced to the United States in the 1970s, when they were imported to control algae growth in aquaculture and sewage treatment ponds. They escaped into the Mississippi River during floods a few years later. Like many invasive species, they've been able to out­compete local populations and have spread quickly. There is no silver bullet for eradicating the invasive species. But a decadelong rush to prevent Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes may be paying off. With a slew of methods, from electric barriers to noise cannons and \"fences\" made of carbon dioxide, researchers hope to keep Asian carp at bay. Next summer, some of those new tools will be put through final tests.

It was a strikingly different scene three weeks ago, when those same officers responded to home where Tacarra lives after gunfire erupted on the block. A three­car convoy had been cruising down Pauline Street near 59th Street when two dozen shots rang out. Tacarra was struck on the left side of her abdomen as she tried to run inside her grandparents’ home. “Granddad, I been shot,” she was heard saying. “Look, I been shot.” Standing in a vacant lot next to Tacarra’s home, Chicago police Sgt. Elise Padilla paused as she explained how the officers who responded were in disbelief. “A 6­-year-­old should not know what it means to be shot,” Padilla said.

The family stayed in a hulking old hospital converted into the state's largest migrant labor camp, which is leased by Monsanto, sleeping on mattresses on gray concrete floors.

Detasseling is a step in the production of hybrid corn seed in which workers walk among the stalks and pull off the pollen­ containing tassels at the top of each stalk to prevent the corn from self­-pollinating. Farm labor, among the most backbreaking and lowest­ paid jobs, is, for many, an honorable career passed from generation to generation. But it also is subject to conditions not tolerated in most other industries. Children can work in the fields as young as 12. The composition of the farm labor force, which toils largely out of public view, gives workers little leverage to challenge poor treatment, worker advocates say. Of the estimated 2.5 million farmworkers in the U.S., between 50 and 70 percent are #undocumented, and fear of deportation keeps workers from complaining, said Bruce Goldstein, president of Farmworker Justice, a Washington, D.C.­-based advocacy group.

They can step a few inches forward or backward but not turn around. Keeping pregnant and nursing sows in tight stalls called gestation or farrowing crates is a practice that pork producers say keeps the mother pigs and their litters safe and well cared for.

She was in custody there after a confrontational traffic stop, and her death, which authorities ruled a suicide, has since been a part of the conversation around police treatment of black citizens.\nPeople gathered in Federal Plaza under the 53-foot Alexander Calder \"Flamingo\" sculpture and listened to speeches and songs from multiple participants.

Pablo Picasso at age 85 had dominated Western art for more than half a century. He had been approached by William E. Hartmann, senior partner in a Chicago architecture firm. The architect visited Picasso, presenting several gifts (including a Sioux war bonnet and a White Sox blazer) plus a check for $100,000. The result was a forty-two-inch maquette, or model, for a sculpture made of Cor-Ten steel. U.S. Steel in Gary, Indiana, translated the maquette into a piece that weighed 162 tons and rose to a height of 50 feet. It was the first monumental outdoor Picasso in North America.Mayor Richard J. Daley said at the unveiling: \"We dedicate this celebrated work this morning with the belief that what is strange to us today will be familiar tomorrow.” Ultimately, the Picasso became a symbol of the city.
