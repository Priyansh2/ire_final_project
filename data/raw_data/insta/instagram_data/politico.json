It would be the first permanent human presence outside of low Earth orbit, and it is designed to serve many purposes: to host science experiments, to resupply missions to the moon‚Äôs surface, and to serve as a stop-off point where astronauts can board long-term missions to deep space, including someday to Mars. Current plans call for astronauts to move in to the station‚Äôs first phase around 2024 and soon thereafter start traveling regularly to the moon's surface, marking a new era in the halting but dramatic story of human progress off our home planet.

This indicates an increasing acceptance in the top rungs of Washington for Democrats to keep their political fire trained on President Donald Trump and may pressure House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take action.

Several of the president's political aides said they regarded Hogan's inauguration speech as an unmistakable act of aggression toward the president.

But proponents of the Massachusetts law are worried that support for it is weak enough that a concerted effort by opponents of transgender rights could create a public firestorm like the one that gripped North Carolina in 2016, and lead voters to overturn the law. üì∑ @ap.images \n#massachusetts #boston #charliebaker #LGBT #LGBTcommunity #transgender #elections2018 #senate #house #politics", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1604915a53a3a0394046cf8b4dbdd0b1/5E4566DF/t51.2885-15/e35/c247.0.585.585a/29415449_349382698907521_4699178402077212672_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg64SaUhmKw/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bb0f7d6629572beecc4413133ba21006/5DC224D4/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/29401414_162918797742152_6471410190490009600_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg6mkvMhHI2/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0110d473ce0c989d7c0634dacab9981f/5DC2890A/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/29401853_170287656857681_5074488213658140672_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg6KiiHAnAE/", "caption": "In his latest, POLITICO cartoonist Matt Wuerker takes on President Trump's new national security adviser, John Bolton. \n#cartoons #politicalcartoon #editorialcartoon #donaldtrump #presidenttrump #trump #johnbolton #hrmcmaster #nationalsecurity #whitehouse #politics #wuerker #mattwuerker", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d0316313006f189ec198dfc1c0bc8b80/5E485429/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c90.0.899.899a/s640x640/29714420_207409933348826_3427392406243246080_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg4viYnA_4y/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b6a336629dd7c13f9e30b286d1176aa4/5DC29492/t51.2885-15/e15/c236.0.607.607a/29716181_355929261560107_7640042530846801920_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bg4e134AOKO/", "caption": "Meet the new head of the VA: Trump's personal physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson.\nüî∏\nTrump announced on Wednesday that he would nominate Jackson to be the next secretary of veterans affairs, ousting embattled leader David Shulkin.\nüî∏\n\"I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny L.

Unlike the great poultry conundrum, we know the answer to this one. Donald Trump was well into thick-waisted middle age by the time Twitter launched in 2006, and he had passed the 60 mark when, three years later, he issued his first tweet under the @realDonaldTrump moniker. Yet Trump‚Äôs Twitter feed and his psyche are now so fused that it‚Äôs hard to tell where one ends and the other begins‚Äîor if such a boundary even exists. Not since Mussolini mounted his Roman balcony has a national leader merged so completely with a communication platform.\nüî∏\nThe president‚Äôs Twitter fixation gives the lie to the notion that social networks are preserves of the tech-adept young. Although Trump, according to press reports, rarely uses computers, sends emails, or goes online, he‚Äôs found a match in Twitter. It‚Äôs a technology perfectly suited to his need for attention and, more ominously, his recklessness. By blurring private and public discourse, Twitter allows Trump to turn locker-room talk, his favored idiom, into presidential speech. And it enables him to manhandle the public‚Äôs attention, constantly yanking the media spotlight back on himself whenever it starts to wander. -NICHOLAS CARR üì∑ POLITICO illustration / @istockbygettyimages \n#thefridaycover #longreads #donaldtrump #presidenttrump #trump #twitter #socialmedia #addiction #magazine #magazinecover #politics", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8c8e817917306176ecf08a40f5f2e65b/5E4EA3F7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/26865758_256355394901848_3750175115686445056_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Beb12HugJvh/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d4d991fa0e79e1fb66c0fc0594eacc77/5DC25908/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/26870088_140335760102308_6341501607473053696_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BebsixygyrO/", "caption": "Former Florida Gov.

New Jersey is challenging a federal law that bars states from authorizing sports gambling. If the Supreme Court strikes down the law, giving sports betting the go-ahead, 32 states would likely offer it within five years, according to one report.\nThe case pits New Jersey and other states against all four major U.S. professional sports leagues, the NCAA and the federal government. The stakes are high. The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans illegally wager about $150 billion on sports each year.\nüî∏ \nIn court, the NBA, NFL, NHL and Major League Baseball have fought New Jersey's gambling expansion, arguing that it would hurt the integrity of their games, though leaders of all but the NFL have shown varying degrees of openness to legalized sports gambling.\nüî∏ \nMore than a dozen states are supporting New Jersey, which is arguing that Congress exceeded its authority when it passed a 1992 law that keeps states from authorizing sports betting. The state says the Constitution allows Congress to make wagering on sports illegal itself but that it can't require states to keep sports gambling prohibitions in place.\nüî∏ \nNow that the case is before the Supreme Court, the justices could ultimately greenlight the expansion of sports gambling nationwide by striking down the federal law.

In August, the volume of U.S. sales of pork to Japan dropped by 9 percent year over year, a serious blow to farmers who had been preparing for a big increase in sales because of lower tariffs in the TPP.\nüî∏\nInstead, other countries that export meats, grains and fruits have seized on their advantage over American growers and producers in the wake of the U.S. pullout from the TPP. And a new Reuters poll shows Trump‚Äôs favorability in rural America ‚Äî once a great stronghold ‚Äî dropped from 55 percent last winter to 47 percent in September. The poll also showed a plunge in support for Trump‚Äôs trade agenda among rural voters.\nüî∏\nBoth Vice President Mike Pence and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue ‚Äî who were widely known as free traders before working for Trump ‚Äî have pointed to the president‚Äôs desire for ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù new trade deals to replace the TPP. Perdue said this month that crafting a new deal with Japan was a top priority. And on Monday, Pence will meet with his Japanese counterpart as part of an effort to reboot the economic relationship between the two countries. -ADAM BEHSUDI\nüî∏\nRead more:  http://politi.co/2zsTAQY üì∑: @smahaskey / POLITICO \n#trade #japan #TPP #donaldtrump #presidenttrump #trump #mikepence #sonnyperdue #transpacificpartnership #shinzoabe #pork #politics #longreads", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5b31e6d262b5acfef211d1f010ece723/5E54372C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/22500110_1459238580862826_2298693649602445312_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BaUUKqelUWv/", "caption": "President Donald Trump said Monday that he decertified Iran‚Äôs compliance with a landmark nuclear agreement because he is ‚Äútired of being taken advantage of,‚Äù while also hinting that the U.S. could still fully pull out of the deal.\nüî∏\n\"I feel strongly about what I did.

That's 30 percent more capacity than the last record-breaking ship that sailed into Savannah last summer. üì∑: @AP.Images \n#georgia #savannah #savannahgeorgia #cargoship #hongkong #COSCO #largeship #trade #ports #USports #ship #shipping", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b9534b6b676c149c58bee6cd72201361/5E5B9768/t51.2885-15/e35/c236.0.607.607a/18443193_1909436889314057_9196242051295870976_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BT7au-oABO-/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/19b99f3a0f5b262da903a7d931af255f/5DC298BF/t51.2885-15/e15/c236.0.607.607a/18380880_294399281006377_9183564596328267776_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BT7IfExAgiC/", "caption": "Wuerker draws his take on @realdonaldtrump's firing of FBI Director James Comey.\n\n#jamescomey #donaldtrump #trump #politics #washingtondc #washington #dc #republican #gop #whitehouse #hillaryclinton #fbi", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/402b09c070e6b3a32334996f033a75d2/5E5C681E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c90.0.900.900a/s640x640/18382167_1896809983919287_2725013563692285952_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BT7BAtpABjY/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f0ffd966622a5f5243c4bce6fb254e63/5DC29F12/t51.2885-15/e15/c236.0.607.607a/18382054_1779111089067897_3757181959692877824_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BT4_pMaAuWY/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ce626c49635c5efb11fe861bdfd2fa85/5DC20DC2/t51.2885-15/e15/c236.0.607.607a/18443457_221979224956397_3064722876687974400_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BT4TQ1gAVna/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0379011bb78e08ce73dfd32c12169de9/5DC28634/t51.2885-15/e15/c236.0.607.607a/18380892_290514041374239_1179513343648464896_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BT4Iy5fAz2E/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f58a432c8a48120410d103b1a27f0569/5DC2873F/t51.2885-15/e15/c236.0.607.607a/18380250_149482822257949_8063107340762611712_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BT2aksyA2JV/", "caption": "Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke arrives at the Blanding airport on Monday for an aerial tour of the recently designated Bears Ears National Monument in southeastern Utah.

Chuck Schumer stands at a lectern after announcing his Democratic leadership team in the Senate on Nov. 16, 2016. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin will remain as minority whip, and Washington Sen. Patty Murray will become assistant leader. From @politico reporters Burgess Everett and Elana Schor: \nSenate Democrats have settled on a leadership team for the start of the Trump administration, appointing Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) as assistant leader and elevating Sen. Bernie Sanders to a post in the caucus' senior ranks. \nThe expanded leadership team tapped by newly elected Senate-Democratic leader Chuck Schumer gives both liberals and moderates fresh influence on internal decision-making in the wake of the party's Election Day drubbing. The selection of Murray as assistant leader heads off an internal fight with Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who will remain minority whip. \nAll 10 members of the new Democratic slate will be invited to leadership meetings, a senior Democratic aide said. \nSchumer will be followed in the Democratic leadership hierarchy by Durbin, Murray and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, senators said. \nSanders was given the post of outreach chair, while Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) will be vice chair of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) will be secretary of the Senate Democratic conference. \nPhoto: @johnshinkle / POLITICO \n#democrats #senate #politics #news #congress #washington #washingtondc #dc #chuckschumer #pattymurray #dickdurbin #berniesanders #debbiestabenow #tammybaldwin #joemanchin\n#senators", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1389ce857236cc1feeb744c7ce367fa7/5E4F2EF6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c180.0.720.720a/s640x640/15046805_1185414618201768_1599828592810786816_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BM0HwfcgO3L/", "caption": "üêä üê¢ The latest from cartoonist Matt Wuerker.\n\n#donaldtrump #mitchmcconnell #paulryan #republican #gop #congress #politics #cartoon #washingtondc #washington #dc #news", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/33110f67a9e0ce1795f066945a2b8981/5E49C1D0/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c90.0.900.900a/s640x640/14488075_204486326665744_5556957996145180672_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BMrgsw_Adnt/", "caption": "First Lady Michelle Obama met with Melania Trump for tea in the Yellow Oval Room of the White House yesterday, Nov. 10, 2016. |üì∑:White House photo by Chuck Kennedy", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b5252266c60c06b682ff2547f6830647/5E475E69/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c181.0.718.718a/s640x640/14553199_367350973613220_3486485744577413120_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BMpF0PhAjWy/", "caption": "Speaker of the House Paul Ryan shows President-elect Donald Trump and Melania the view from the speaker‚Äôs balcony on at the United State Capitol on Nov. 10, 2016.

That something is, in large part, the work of #ElizabethWarren.\n\nWarren, a 67-year-old former Harvard Law professor, is a unique figure in #politics: She‚Äôs the actual author of the ideas‚Äînot just their publicist‚Äîwhose torch she now carries in Washington. Her legal career was built on documenting the way bankruptcy law hurts the American middle class, and by the time she entered politics after the financial crisis, she had developed a full-throated critique of the way the modern economy squeezes working families. From her platform in the Senate, she not only has won over liberals, but arguably drew the blueprint for a more progressive vision of the Democratic Party.\n\nOn policy, Warren has defined the terms that have shaped the 2016 presidential race. The ‚Äúrigged‚Äù economy? She began popularizing the notion in her 2012 Senate campaign announcement video. The Trans-Pacific Partnership? She marshaled liberal opposition to it, confronting President Obama over the trade deal in a public letter in April 2015. Debt-free college tuition? Warren beat Clinton and Sanders to the punch, introducing a framework in June 2015 for how the proposal would work.\n\nWhat makes Warren truly formidable now is her capacity to marry policy prowess and backstage hardball, as well as a primal ability to rally Democratic lawmakers, donors and voters. All of which positions her to carry the Sanders mantle toward political reality. She now rivals the Obamas and Clintons as perhaps the most highly sought-after Democratic surrogate, has raised millions for more than a half-dozen Democratic Senate candidates and has put aside her Clinton skepticism to emerge as one of the party‚Äôs most effective Trump baiters‚Äîso angering the blustery Republican nominee that ‚ÄúPocahontas,‚Äù as he has dubbed her, has become one of his favorite Twitter targets.\n\nWarren is gradually shaping the Democratic Party in her own image, which could be felt for years.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d94d9a582ad026fd45ec976518e8ebf4/5E50BB4C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/14268981_186619135094724_1814014877_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BKQ4TPqANOK/", "caption": "No. 10 on the #POLITICO50 list: Lin-Manuel Miranda\n\nEvery American with a pulse by now knows that Lin-Manuel Miranda‚Äôs musical #Hamilton is a Broadway sensation. Since its debut a year ago, it has won the Pulitzer Prize in drama, received a record-breaking 16 Tony nominations, winning 11, and last fall apparently broke the Broadway record in advance sales.\n\nBut more than just being the hottest thing in American culture, Hamilton is an attempt to rewrite American history. Drawing from Ron Chernow‚Äôs biography of Alexander Hamilton and working in rap, hip-hop and show tunes, Miranda has breathed new life into the story of one of the Founding Fathers, reframing the life of the first Treasury secretary as the story of a poor Caribbean immigrant from a broken home who succeeded thanks to relentless ambition. Hamilton no doubt takes liberties: Some critics say it overly reveres Hamilton, not to mention that its cast is mostly black and Latino; Miranda, whose parents are Puerto Rican, played the part of Hamilton until this summer. But these modern touches are meant to draw a line from the messiness of early-American politics to today‚Äôs. ‚ÄúI think the notion of our founders being these perfect men who got these stone tablets from the sky that became our Constitution and Bill of Rights is bullshit,‚Äù Miranda told Rolling Stone.\n\nIt‚Äôs sure been ages since a #Broadway play had such resonance in politics; Miranda even successfully urged Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to keep the newly hip Hamilton on the front of the soon-to-be-redesigned $10 bill. And it‚Äôs no surprise that Miranda has become a supercelebrity in a year when anti-immigrant rhetoric has spiked. In fact, his critique of Donald Trump‚Äôs plan to build a wall has clear historical, even Hamiltonian resonances: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs such a malignant form of a very common American electoral disease,‚Äù Miranda has said, ‚Äúwhich is, ‚ÄòPoint at the newest people here and say they‚Äôre the reason you‚Äôre broke.‚Äô That‚Äôs as old as time itself.‚Äù Click on the link in bio for the full POLITICO 50 list. üì∑: Hilary Swift/The New York Times/Redux\n\n#linmanuel #linmanuelmiranda #politics", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/49fe4371750660563b25023547cec61d/5E4A2C93/t51.2885-15/e35/c167.0.635.635a/14269159_1758267064413531_602467148_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BKQV-UdgObD/", "caption": "NOW LIVE ‚û°Ô∏è The #POLITICO50, POLITICO‚Äôs guide to the thinkers, doers and visionaries transforming üá∫üá∏ #politics in 2016.

They discussed opportunities for pro-Trump events and venues for fundraisers, but mostly these ladies who lunch spent six hours together talking up the man several of them consider a longtime friend. And in the process, they provided a gilded window into the ultra-elite social circle Trump ran in for decades, before he descended a few steps on America‚Äôs glamour ladder to conquer the Republican Party.\n\nThe world of Trump and the Trumpettes is unsubtly wealthy, full of knuckle-sized bejeweled rings and multiple vacation homes. Its residents are ideologically flexible: Like Trump, they have donated extensively to both parties and claim friendships with power players across the political spectrum.

A law that could have been legacy-defining for President @BarackObama instead represents a startling example of a broad and bipartisan policy initiative stymied by #politics and the neglect of some of its strongest proponents.\n\nLink to full Broken By Design investigation in bio. | Graphic: 5W Infographics\n\n#government #regulations #policy #fda #foodsafety #laws #senate #houseofrepresentatives #whitehouse #illness #publichealth #health #fsma", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/474decd1c6c044da24791a2d2b3d688f/5E5B42CE/t51.2885-15/e35/1723963_1619023275053880_1718087336_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/5HlhVjsbst/", "caption": ".@barackobama walks down the Cross Hall of the @whitehouse with Vice President @vp Joe Biden after delivering remarks on July 14, 2015 after a nuclear deal was reached between #Iran and several world powers. \"This deal offers an opportunity to move in a new direction,\" Barack Obama said. \"We should seize it.\" The president also said that he would \"veto any legislation that prevents the full implementation of this deal.\" Republicans, specifically those running for the presidency in 2016, are already attacking the agreement, with Sen.
