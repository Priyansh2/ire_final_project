Without the option to sell tobacco in his commissary, the jail saw a new set of problems emerge, like withdrawal issues, inmate fighting, and an increase in black market trading of tobacco. Furthermore, Mosley found that corrections staff had one less privilege to take away from inmates to discourage bad behavior. Mosley got the idea to introduce a vape option to his jail, but all of the ones on the market were too easily turned into weapons. So he invented a solution.

Therefore, President Trump‚Äôs emergency order is clearly in opposition to the will of Congress,‚Äù Paul wrote in an op-ed. ‚ÄúMoreover, the broad principle of separation of powers in the Constitution delegates the power of the purse to Congress. This turns that principle on its head.‚Äù Link in bio. üì∏ AP Photo/J.

And every so often it comes to an unpredictable stop. It's at this moment that the migrants at the house run to the backyard, grab a ladder to scale the fence and jump onto the stopped or slow-moving train. The train chugs along into El Paso, where the migrants hop off and hope to meet smugglers on the U.S. side, who will take them to safe houses in Texas and beyond.

There are categories of kids who aren‚Äôt here: pregnant girls or new mothers, kids younger than 13, those with significant mental health needs who are a danger to themselves or others. One kid was quarantined with strep throat. One was sent out for posing a danger to others. There are zero kids here with gang ties, says the Incident Commander. They look for tattoos or other indicators and haven‚Äôt found any. Call center: About 10 tables, a staff member seated at each, two kids across the desk. The kids get two 10-minute calls a week. A staffer dials and confirms the person on the other end of the line is family. The call recipient has to say the kid‚Äôs name before connecting. Tornillo itself is tiny, and cannot handle the safety needs here. So the contractor supplies full-time fire and EMS services. The facility is self-sufficient. Water trucked in, waste trucked out. 250 staff total operating 24/7. The whole encampment was set up in 4 days. It costs $700/day per child here. Weber of HHS says the standard is $250/day. Staff refs the soccer games, on three narrow fields that when taken together equal about the size of one whole soccer pitch. Asked a staffer if he hands out red cards. He laughed and said no. The loudest chants among the kids as we walked by were for Brazil and Mexico in the WC They haven‚Äôt had any ‚Äúrunners,‚Äù the Incident Commander said.

Anita Yeboah's hair braiding shop in Trenton, New Jersey, is no exception. But in many states those cultural clues aren‚Äôt enough to validate hairstylists in the eyes of local legislators and cosmetology boards.

Despite a slew of legal challenges, including a case that's being heard Wednesday by the Supreme Court, it‚Äôs clear that he‚Äôs delivering on his pledge, at least when it comes to keeping out Muslim refugees. The latest data from the State Department, which oversees the U.S. refugee program, shows that 1,891 Muslim refugees have been allowed to enter the country so far in the 2018 fiscal year. That‚Äôs a 90 percent drop from the same period last year, when the U.S. admitted 18,342 Muslim refugees. The numbers are especially dramatic when it comes to Syria, where more than 5 million people have fled horrific violence in a civil war that recently entered its eighth year. Just 44 Syrian refugees have been resettled in the U.S. in the first six months of the fiscal year ‚Äî compared to 5,839 over the same period last year. Of those 44 Syrians, only 27 identified themselves as Muslim. The trend coincides with an overall gutting of the U.S. refugee resettlement program by the Trump administration, resettlement experts say. The White House has near-total authority to limit the flow of refugees into the country, and the administration has set a cap of 45,000 for the current fiscal year. That ceiling was already going to be the lowest in recent history, but so far the U.S. is only on pace to admit 23,000 refugees, which would be the lowest total since the modern U.S. refugee program was established in 1980.

The rising tensions between traditional farmers and the state‚Äôs newest cash crop highlight the problems with the Trump‚Äôs immigration crackdown, federal marijuana policies, and the agriculture industry‚Äôs reliance on a mostly undocumented workforce. \nHit the link in bio for more.

Apalachicola used to be home to a booming oyster fishing industry that is now shrinking due to a lack of fresh water making its way down the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system and into the Bay. One reason for the lack of fresh water is Georgia's agricultural system, which lifts 900 million gallons of fresh water from the river system each day. Oyster populations thrive in areas where salt and fresh water mix together, places like estuaries. Here, invasive conchs and urchin comprise a significant portion of Hartsfield's oyster catch from the Bay. See it on VICE News Tonight 7:30PM on @hbo.

Public services are almost nonexistent; roads are in disrepair and phones often have no signal. Salaries haven‚Äôt been paid for months and those in positions of power are nowhere to be found. And with the total breakdown of the judicial system and thousands of forced abductions on both sides of the conflict, many of the people we met with in private were too afraid to go on the record.\n\nVICE News was there to cover a range of stories, from the rise of terror to the breakdown of women's rights. But after only two weeks on the ground, we were forced to evacuate unexpectedly. An elevated security threat restricted our movements, making it impossible to complete our work.\n\nOur experience is hardly unique; the risks of reporting from Yemen are high and the rewards can often feel minimal. The international community has the power to stop this war but has thus far kept to the sidelines.

Across Equatoria, a region of South Sudan, villages are being swept up in violence as government and rebel forces vie for control, spelling destruction for once idyllic farming communities and signifying something deeper: Neither side is anywhere near securing a decisive military victory. South Sudan‚Äôs conflict was supposed to be over by now. At least that was the aim of a peace deal brokered by IGAD, an eight-country regional bloc, and backed by the U.S., the U.K., Norway, China, the U.N., and the EU. Signed in 2015, the pact sought to end the civil war by reinstating Riek Machar to his previous post as the young country‚Äôs first vice president, divvying up government positions between the signatories, and eventually reintegrating the rebels into the army. But the agreement was short-lived. We went behind the front lines with rebels in South Sudan, where the current war appears unwinnable.

Graffiti on the building reads \"Lies Closed This School.\" Photo by @cassandragiraldo.\n. . .\nThe gutting of Detroit's public schools is the result of an experiment started 23 years ago, when education reformers including Betsy DeVos, now Donald Trump's pick to lead the Education Department, got Michigan to bet big on charters and school choice. DeVos has made clear her goal is to use charters to eventually get public dollars to private and religious schools, but the consequences of her school choice policy in Detroit leave gaping questions about how she will care for America's public schools.\n. . .\nIn Detroit, choice has come largely at the expense of traditional public school districts and schools like Oakman. As students joined new charters, public school enrollment and funding fell. Unregulated competition pushed these schools into near-unrecoverable insolvency and allowed dubious for-profit charter operators to prosper without establishing a track record of better outcomes for students. The premise of school choice is that competition raises all sectors, but in Detroit, and many other cities around the country, that just hasn't happened. \"What competition ends up producing is not a choice of failing vs. good schools but a bunch of similarly mediocre schools,\" said Thomas Pedroni, associate professor at Wayne State University's School of Education.
