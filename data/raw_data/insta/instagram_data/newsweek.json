The days when cancer patients receive one-size-fits-all regimens of chemotheraphy and radiation may soon be a thing of the past.

The idea of this personalized medicine is that doctors will use genetic tests, of both the patient and the tumor, to determine the exact drugs or treatments that have the best chance of working.

Precision medicine is helping, at best, only a few percent of the nearly 2 million people who are diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. each year, and the fraction is much smaller among the 17 million cancer patients worldwide.

Elephants are wild animals and shouldn’t be in contact with humans. If they are domesticated to be safe for human contact, then be aware that there has been cruelty used to achieve that. Some tips? Avoid places that offer elephant rides (the baskets are extremely hard on their backs) or places with prolonged contact with them. Unsure where to go? Hit the link in the bio for a list of places that are known to have higher treatment standards so you can enjoy elephants in their (somewhat) natural environment. | Photo: @darren.j.mcleod *\n*\n*\n*\n*\n#elephants #tourism #tourist #travel #elephant #conservation #asia #africa #elephantride #experience #experiences #animal #animals #creature #wow #ethical #domesticated #tips #advice #list", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/30a551d285c244d330526158e50ee95f/5E5EF983/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.163.1440.1440a/s640x640/60884055_389869355069720_862557224061061166_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByX9OIRBgA3/", "caption": "Today marks the 75th anniversary of D-Day, the World War II invasion in Normandy, France.

From 1980 until 2018, the rate at which the ice was lost spiked sixfold. This culminated in a loss of approximately 290 gigatons (GT) per year between 2010 to 2018. In turn, this added 13.7 millimeters to sea levels, half of which happened over the past eight years. “If the Paris agreement targets are not met, then the Greenland ice sheet will very likely continue to lose mass in the future, impacting global sea level, ocean currents and regional climate,” Dr. Andrew Newton of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at The University of Manchester said. | 📸: @jaqdizzle *\n*\n*\n*\n*\n#greenland #icesheet #greenlandicesheet #globalwarming #climatechange #sea #sealevel #ice #water #research #science #parisagreement #ocean #climate #greenlandice #icecap #melt #scientists", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b36c83e6a215c86c78bd618082f86464/5E46259C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.56.1080.1080a/s640x640/56757821_2251369338510735_5949483163928880277_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwsKl-ph89B/", "caption": "During a mock press briefing for Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders got called out by a journalist about when she would brief actual reporters. “Sarah, when will you brief for the real reporters?” the Associated Press’s White House reporter asked at the end of the briefing for kids, according to fellow journalists in the room. Sanders gave no answer.

Sneak in a quick nap this weekend if you can. It’s easy to forget just how important sleep is for the brain and body.

One important aspect to be aware of is that good sleep isn’t just about quantity, but quality. “You need to get enough sleep in time, but it’s also sleep quality. You need to go through this sleep cycling where the brain basically accomplishes these key things.” Going without these important features of sleep can lead to more than a day full of yawning. “It’s equivalent to accelerating the aging process in the brain.” | 📷: @theianwoo *\n*\n*\n*\n*\n#sleeping #nap #sleep #science #brain #rejuvenation #tired #health #research", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/46672b45c45a708cec001686452c1659/5E42C794/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/56640312_120149629156532_9123425976155296997_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv4F8TNBxp5/", "caption": "Scientists have discovered that Mars, the big red planet, once had huge rivers wider than the Mississippi river and it flowed intensely up until around one billion years ago.

According to researchers in the area, the bear situation is so fragile as although there's been early freezes the last two years, on the average over the last 20 years the summers have gotten longer meaning less time on the ice, less food and less viable pregnancies. Fifteen years ago, they used to see a lot of twin or triplet cubs, which is now rare as most females can only support a single cub. Globally, the bears are under threat due to Global Warming and habitat loss as the polar ice cap melts and bears either have to swim farther for food or enter human villages (where they are most often shot to preserve human life). The best place to see polar bears in the wild is Churchill, Manitoba, due to the ice conditions. The currents in Hudson Bay flow counterclockwise, meaning cold water from the north flow towards the shelf of land which juts out into the bay. At this point is the mouth of the Churchill River, which brings fresh water into the bay, raising the freezing point of the water and making it a hangout for the polar bears in the area who wait for the ice to freeze so they can hunt seals in the winter.

Fifteen years ago, they used to see a lot of twin or triplet cubs, which is now rare as most females can only support a single cub.

Residents and relief crews are just beginning to be able to access much of the area, as the flood waters have receded. Many of the residents have spent several months at shelters, just to come back to see so little left.\nIn the first image, Enrique Gonzalez stands behind his home looking over the one of the many rivers that surround Toa Baja. The area was built on the alluvial deposits of the rivers, and as the land has been slowly degraded over time, so has its ability to retain water when intense rains come. As the water rose in their home Enrique moved his wife and grandaughter up to the second floor, and then on top of a freezer as the water kept getting higher. With no end in sight, Enrique said goodbye to his family believing they would all drown. Miraculously, a neighbor was able to get through the 2nd floor entryway with a small boat and save them. They just returned after 2 months in a shelter to the neighborhood, to find almost nothing left of their home. In the second image, a rosary hangs from a rearview mirror in an abandoned van. The vehicle sat completely underwater for a length of time, and the cracked mud forms looks like tile mosaics on the interior.

He’s comfortable with unusually high levels of creative chaos beneath him, because he sees who’s the best fighter and who makes the best argument. But if he feels he’s being poorly served by his lieutenants, he allows that frustration to increase until he gets to a point where he takes decisive action. I predict he will take decisive action to get [rid of] those people around him who are not serving his original platform. That’s just how he works. I predict that there will be some firings in the near future that come from the president himself when he realizes just how much he needs the old team to be around him. I’m not making any predictions about Steve and myself. Whether or not Steve goes back or I go back—this is the long game. We’re in this for eight years and then eight years of President Pence.

Women’s organizations have pushed for reforms to the penal code to improve legislation protecting women, though government inaction and political instability have stalled the attempts.

Warm seas off the coast of Queensland, Australia, killed some two-thirds of a nearly 500-mile stretch of coral in 2016 after warm water caused the coral to expel living algae, triggering it to calcify or turn white, a process known as bleaching. Researchers have called it the worst die-off of coral ever recorded at the reef.\n\nEven the areas that survived will not recover to full health, scientists from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Integrated Coral Reef Studies said in a report, as unseasonable hot water becomes more frequent, causing more bleaching. The reef has experienced three bleaching events in the last 20 years—in 1998, 2002 and 2016, with another event expected this year.
