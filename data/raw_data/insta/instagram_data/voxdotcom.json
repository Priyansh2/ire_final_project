But 20 years later, they’re giving President Donald Trump a lot more breathing room.\n\nThere are fourteen current members of the Senate who were serving in Congress during Clinton’s impeachment proceedings — and at least 10 are striking an entirely different tone with their approach to a potential Trump impeachment. Two notable names on that list are: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who indicted Clinton for lying in 1999, but is downplaying today’s scandal involving Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Then there’s Sen. Lindsey Graham, who was an outspoken Trump critic but has since turned into an ally in 2019. \nBut the GOP, in general, is sticking very close to Trump. Other prominent Republicans who were involved in the Clinton impeachment, like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, have also strongly pushed back against calls for impeachment. The overall Republican response to impeachment highlights an about-face along partisan lines and underscores how politicized a process impeachment is.

But the phrase “veggie burger” has never been especially baffling for consumers, so it’s more likely an effort to keep meat alternatives away from shoppers. ”The plant-based meat alternative category is on fire right now, with consumers demanding healthier and more sustainable options,” Michele Simon, the executive director of the Plant-Based Foods Association, said in a statement. “This law, along with similar laws in several other states, is the meat lobby’s response.” And indeed, the meat lobby celebrated the news: “This bill will protect our cattle farmers from having to compete with products not harvested from an animal,” said Mississippi Farm Bureau Federation president Mike McCormick in January when the bill passed in the Mississippi state House.\n\nThe makers of meat alternatives are suing, and past court decisions indicate that the law may be found unconstitutional: A 2013 California case claiming that terms like “soy milk” and “almond milk” would confuse consumers was dismissed for stretching “the bounds of credulity.” Follow the link in our bio to read more.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/259d55ec9c92e6113aa04851d402370f/5E5919E7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/65392544_1042972432571709_5197892397162573340_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzqUI5mgSVh/", "caption": "The United States beat the Netherlands in the 2019 Women’s World Cup on Sunday 2-0.

Big Little Lies’ second season debuts tonight at 9 pm ET.\n\nAfter its debut in 2017, the show — which boasts a superstar cast featuring Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, and Zoë Kravitz — swiftly became a phenomenon. Based on the novel of the same name by Liane Moriarty, Big Little Lies was initially going to be an open-and-shut miniseries. It covered the entire novel — including its heart-stopping ending — in seven episodes. But even though the show had exhausted its source material, HBO understandably wanted to capitalize on its popularity and ordered, with some scrutiny from critics, a second season.\n\nThe new season feels a bit different, at least in its early episodes. And that’s not just because Big Little Lies has progressed beyond its source material, or because the deity known as Meryl Streep is joining the cast. It’s also a bit lighter in tone, and simultaneously more grounded. This time around, it seems to be focusing less on shocking turns and mean-girl moments, and more on the interior lives of its characters.\n\nBut “different” doesn’t mean worse, or less entertaining.

That included places like the Stonewall Inn, a gay- and trans-friendly bar in Greenwich Village. Homophobic abuse was just business as usual. \nBut there was something different about the night of June 28, 1969. This time, Stonewall patrons fought back against police, and everyone from gay men to trans women of color went on to riot for four consecutive nights. It was a show of strength that marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQ rights movement. \nThe pride marches happening around the country this month are a direct legacy of that night 50 years ago, and of the people who were there, willing to stand up against oppression and fight for their rights.

So far, Kavanaugh’s confirmation process has unfolded in much the same way Thomas’s did.

Dr. Pedro Badillo, the Medical Director at the Canóvanas Medical Center, told us people were contracting the disease by drinking from or bathing in streams and rivers that were contaminated — likely by rats whose habitats were destroyed by the storm.\n\nThe disease can be treated with antibiotics, but with limited communication services, it was challenging for the Puerto Rico Department of Health to educate people about the risk of contracting leptospirosis. We tracked down the only two labs on the island capable of processing leptospirosis samples. Both labs’ directors told us the number of positive samples was very high. —Photo by @elaine_cromie; caption by @__bybianca.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThis is the fourth post of a six-part series by two journalists of Puerto Rican descent as they traveled to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria to visit their families and explore the stories and emotions of the island.

He found a new way to earn money by selling washboards to people driving by on a road in Barranquitas. Now, more than two months after the storm, around 32% of the island still lacks power.

It was life-changing.”\n.\nSo after three more years of high school debate, plus four in college, he made a career out of it — by moving to DC to advocate for and write about LGBT issues. But he eventually got bored with writing. “I felt like I had gifts that debate had given me that I wasn’t able to use using the written word, so I just asked if I could start making videos. I had no idea what I was doing, but I loved being able to present arguments in a visual way.” .\nHis own disappointment in coverage of the social issues he cares most about led him to focus on the media specifically: “If you don’t know a gay person, or a trans person, you’re going to hear about it through the news. So if the news is crappy, that’s a really big problem,” he says.\n.\nThis is the third post in a series titled #FacesofVox, in which we’ll tell you the stories and inspirations behind our reporters and the content they produce.

One is that it’s simply very unlikely an incumbent president can convince voters not to blame him for bad things that are happening. That’s simply not how politics works — 59 percent of people told a Kaiser Family Foundation poll they’d blame Republicans. The other is that huge swaths of Obamacare — notably Medicaid expansion but also the exchanges in blue states with high population density and a political establishment that wants to make them work (think Oregon or Massachusetts) — are definitely not failing.\n.\nThat said, especially in states with shakier exchanges, the president certainly does have some fairly broad discretionary authority that he and his health and human services secretary can use to deliberately sabotage the program if they want to. Whether Trump ultimately follows through or not, the fact that this is his instinct underscores that from health care to Russian hacking to corruption, the signature theme of Trump’s approach to politics is putting Donald Trump’s interests ahead of anyone else’s.\n.\nRead more from Matt — and other updates on the fight to repeal and replace Obamacare — via the link in our bio. #healthcare #Obamacare #Trump", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5916a6fc02b50d6424383b512288af80/5E5FF48D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/20066904_123747008237252_932330674319261696_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BWqqMPlFPOF/", "caption": "On Capitol Hill Monday, several progressive groups gathered in the atrium of the Hart Senate Building hold sit-ins and protests against the Republican Senate health care bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act.

Now, though, there’s basically no chance that all of these conflicts will end at the same time — which means the refugee crisis will be with us for the foreseeable future.

She’d spent most of her life in Kakuma, a refugee camp in Kenya, for years waiting to find out where she’d be able to build her life. Finally, in 2016, she received a letter informing her she’d been selected to resettle in the US. “Maybe after all, my dream is really valid and it’s going to come true,” she thought. “If I’m going to America, then it’s the best thing.”\nBut following the election of Donald Trump, things quickly changed. During his first weeks in office,  he issued his notorious “travel ban” executive order. It affected her doubly: as a Somali, the order barred her from entering the US for 90 days; and as a refugee, it blocked her for 120 days. \nTrump’s ban has been challenged in court successfully and the order is not currently in effect. Since he became president, thousands of refugees have been resettled in the US. However, Abdi Halane’s case remains in limbo as she waits to renew her medical certification. All she can do is check her status online. \nIn a personal essay for Vox, Abdi Halane describes the pain of realizing she is a refugee; the joy she felt at learning she was chosen to come to the United States; and the uncertainty she’s to face now that Trump is president.

This is why even the smallest settlements can cause major backlash, especially when they’re located in places that, if they were to remain, would break up a future Palestinian state into disconnected chunks of land and prevent it from being contiguous.\n\nThe second is the explosive growth of both the settler population and the number of settlements over the past several decades. The Israeli settler population in the West Bank alone — not including East Jerusalem — has increased by nearly 270,000 since the 1990s-era Oslo peace accords and by 100,000 since President Obama took office in 2009.
