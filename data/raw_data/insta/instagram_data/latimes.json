Fabian Rebolledo, an Army veteran, was deported to Mexico in 2010 and won a lengthy legal fight to return to the United States and have his lawful permanent resident status restored. \nRebolledo was recruited into the military as a young man. He served at Ft. Bragg and in 1999 was deployed to Kosovo, where he was a peacekeeper who retrieved bodies of villagers killed by Serbian forces. Upon his return to California, his Kosovo experience began haunting him. He sought help for post-traumatic stress disorder and struggled with alcohol, leading to a series of DUI charges. ‚ÄúThat experience was harrowing for him,‚Äù said Lai, a co-director of the UC Irvine Immigrant Rights Clinic, which was able to reopen his case. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs all behind him now.‚Äù\nThe veteran still worked diligently to care for his family and obtained several jobs. But in 2007, a check he received from one employer turned out to be fraudulent ‚Äî that would be the offense that led to his deportation.\n\nIn Tijuana, Rebolledo slept on the streets and in shelters before finding more permanent housing with another deported veteran. He found support among a group of veterans who had also been deported, and he began doing advocacy work.

First, the terrain is incredibly difficult. These mountains near Santa Barbara have steep canyons that are twisted and folded, making it hard for fire crews to take a stand. Cal Fire officials said they basically have no way to get crews on the ground to directly attack the western side of the fire. \nSecond, the strong winds. Last week the area saw a record-breaking windy weather forecast ‚Äì it was so high the National Weather Service had to use the color code purple on their map, which they've never done before for Southern California. Some areas recorded gusts up to 80 mph. \nThen there's the fuel and dry air. Two months into the rainy season, #SoCal has yet to see rain. The lack of humidity is sucking the moisture out of shrubs and other vegetation, which is perfect fuel for flames. Many hillsides haven't seen a decent rainfall in eight months. ‚ÄúUnless you believe in miracles, I don‚Äôt see [the fire] slowing down until we get some moister air,‚Äù one battalion chief told us. \nThe Thomas #fire grew to 234,200 acres today.

Male turkeys often are taken to melting farms, where their semen is melted out of the birds and hens are artificially inseminated in a separate facility.\n\nPoults, or baby turkeys, are taken away in trays to be vaccinated, have their beaks trimmed and their toes clipped. They then are fattened up for three to six months and live in small facilities that prevent the turkeys from standing or even fully sleeping, Coston said.\n\nThe turkeys, now weighing more than 30 pounds, are then put in short crates stacked high on trucks and taken to slaughterhouses.\n\nBut a lucky few are spared. Farm Sanctuary rescues those turkeys that occasionally fall off the trucks during transport or obtains the birds from a multitude of other sources, including families that domesticate the animals but are unable to properly care for them. üì∑: @mariaalejandraphotography / @latimes", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9e3893e341468a5c4ae54c24570c9384/5E4A77C3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/24126673_1397920760317657_5496511768882577408_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb2VRLVgm3-/", "caption": "Hawkins High School used to have one of the best football teams in Los Angeles.

He was 79.\n\nScalia was a dominant figure at the court from the day he arrived, and he could be an intimidating presence for lawyers who had to argue there. He had a deep effect on the law and legal thinking through his Supreme Court opinions and speeches. His sharply worded dissents and caustic attacks on liberal notions were quoted widely, and they had an influence on a generation of young conservatives.\n\nHis death set off a near-instant debate over how and when to select his replacement, and certainly altered the tenor of the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nMore at the link in our bio. \nPhoto: Sept. 26, 1986 Justice Antonin Scalia takes an oath swearing in to the high court.
