Here's how it works: When you \"Restrict\" someone, their comments on your posts are only visible to them, and not others. Also, restricted users won't be able to see if you're active on Instagram at any given moment or if you've read their direct messages. Users can make a restricted person's comments show up for others by approving their comments. Instagram's reasoning for developing \"Restrict\" is that young Instagram users may be wary of blocking, unfollowing or reporting a bully because it could make the situation worse. Blocking or unfollowing the person could also make it harder to keep tabs on the bully's behavior.

Photos of Diana wearing protective gear as she was escorted through a cleared lane in the live minefield and comforting child amputees sparked global efforts to end the production and use of the weapons. In the years since his mother’s death, Prince Harry has picked up her mantle on landmine removal, which remains a problem in Angola, decades after its bloody civil war ended.

The demonstrations started in June over a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. The bill has since been withdrawn — one of the protesters' five major demands — but many remain unsatisfied. For months, people in Hong Kong, an autonomous territory under Chinese rule, have speculated that October 1 could be a deadline for Beijing to take action to end the pro-democracy movement.
