The Haitian revolution lasted from 1791 to Haiti's independence in 1804. It is the only slave uprising in history that led to the founding of a slavery-free state and ruled by former slaves. I highly recommend reading more about the revolution because I can't cover it all here. But this was a defining moment in world history--and it all began around a Vodou ceremony in northern Haiti. Bois Ca√Øman is the historical site where, on August 14 1791, slaves from plantations in the area gathered by cover of night for a secret ceremony to mark the start of the revolution. Who was the loa they served that night? You guessed it: Erzulie Dantor. A black pig (her favorite animal sacrifice) was made to her that night, and the black pig still holds significance to Bois Ca√Øman.

Dahomey is present day Benin, the home of many of the slaves transported against their will to the \"New World.\" Remember in my last post I talked about the syncretism between Catholicism and Vodou?

The origin story of Vodou is as such (boiled down for an instagram caption but bear with me): when slaves were brought to Hispaniola from West Africa, a mix of religions from different areas of West Africa came along with the slaves. The slaves weren't allowed to practice their religions from home--religious worship was based around the Catholic faith (enforced by slavemasters). Because they weren't able to freely practice their religion, they started associating their spirits with images from Catholicism to practice under cover of plain sight. Here in Haiti, if you see an image of Saint Peter it could be for Saint Peter or it could be representative of loa Papa Legba. For many, it's both. There is a saying that Haiti is \"70% Catholic, 30% Protestant and 100% Vodou.\" Vodou is often persecuted by Christian denominations, but for many vodouizans Christian imagery and dual-belief (for example: being Catholic and vodouizan) are just part of the practice.

Drums were made illegal for their significance in Vodou ceremonies (different beats communicate and call for different spirits) and Marines would often confiscate them and sell them to art collectors or galleries in the US.

Here is a picture of one at a botanica in Gonaives. BUT they aren't common and they aren't for the purpose that you're imagining. Vodou dolls are much more complicated than Hollywood portrays. Often stuffed with different kind of herbs, leaves or flower petals depending on what the buyer needs it for, they then might have a personal artifact from the person the doll symbolizes attached to it (allegedly this is where the pin imagery comes from). The dolls can be used at home or left in a special place (the main cemetery in Port-au-Prince has a tree with hundreds of dolls nailed to it). The dolls are a way to communicate with the spirits, or loa, about the wishes or needs for a particular person. Sometimes these have to do with bringing people back--either from a physical place or emotionally, or health. These dolls aren't usually used for bad things. Of course, the power belongs to those who wield it--in Vodou they say, \"Everyone has a left hand and a right hand.\" With everything that can be made light, there is also an option to make it dark.

We're here in Haiti on a grant from the @internationalreportingproject looking at the religion of Vodou. Vodou, or Voodoo, is a complex religion made up of many spirits, or loa (or lwa), and tailor-made to Haiti itself. Stemming from West Africa, Vodou morphed in to its own unique religion during the time of the slave trade--when slaves on the island of Hispaniola were kept from practicing the religion of their homelands by slavemasters. Multiple West African traditions blended together with a pinch of Catholicism (we'll talk about this more later) and Vodou was born. It has played an important part of the fabric of Haitian society for even longer than Haiti has existed as its own independent country--in fact, Vodou played an important role in the founding of Haiti (we'll talk about this more too). We're so excited to be here looking past the Vodou of Hollywood--we'll be sharing snapshots of our trip here for the next week. In this image, initiates wait to walk to the Mapou tree in Souvenance.

Area B constitutes roughly 23-25 percent the West Bank, where the PA oversees civil matters and a joint PA-Israeli force provides security. Around 72 percent of the West Bank was initially registered as Area C, which is fully controlled by the Israeli government.\n\nAlthough Israeli citizens are barred from entering Area A, the military is allowed to conduct raids to arrest suspected militants. Meanwhile, Palestinians are barred from developing in Area C, where the Israeli government regularly builds new towns -- even though the United Nations claims such settlements are illegal under international law.\n\nPalestinians sometimes build in Area C anyway, but typically have their constructions demolished by the government.\n\n##\n\nThis is @jackjenkins reporting from Israel-Palestine. #Israel #Palestine #WestBank #Occupation", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d8673a48dd19271fc8ac36f163deb2e6/5E456E2D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/11374451_436379609889521_1567226895_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/9JB9RvhrrC/", "caption": "‚ÄúWe live in fear 24 hours a day.‚Äù That‚Äôs how Mofid Sharabati, a Palestinian, described his life in Hebron, a city in the occupied West Bank. Sharabati and his children live in a small house down the street from an Israeli checkpoint that divides a Palestinian section of the city from an Israeli settlement. Sharabati resides on the Israeli side of the checkpoint, where many other Palestinians have abandoned their homes, due in part to claims of harassment from Israeli settlers and soldiers that patrol the area.\n\nSharabati, however, refuses to leave. ‚ÄúThis has been my family‚Äôs home for 150 years,‚Äù he said defiantly, speaking through a translator.\n\nSharabati claims to have been the subject of beatings at the hands of officials, and showed a group of journalists x-rays of pins used to rebuild his spine after one incident. He said his 10-year-old son Marwan, pictured above, was also detained by police earlier this month. His crime: holding a stone.\n\nThe family‚Äôs latest run-in with Israeli officials came last week, when an armed settler shot and killed an 18-year-old Palestinian directly outside Sharabati‚Äôs house, where the street is still stained with blood. Authorities say the man attempted to stab the settler with a knife ‚Äî the weapon of choice for many Palestinians who have attacked Israeli soldiers and citizens in recent weeks. But a video recorded from Sharabati‚Äôs window shows officials placing something next to his dying body. Local Palestinians cite this as proof that the soldiers planted evidence.\n\nWhen the military learned of the video, Sharabati says they raided his home, confiscated his camera and laptop, and broke them. They also arrested his brother, who emailed the video to others.\n\nSince then, the atmosphere in his home ‚Äî like most of Israel and Palestine ‚Äî has been tense. ‚ÄúThis is the life we live every day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe live in fear they could come back into our home at any time.
