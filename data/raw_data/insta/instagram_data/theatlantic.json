Losing the shell allowed cephalopods more flexibility in body and mind, but also made them more vulnerable to predators. ‚ÄúThis gantlet of threats might have fueled the evolution of the cephalopods‚Äô amazing color-changing skin, their short life spans, and their large brains,‚Äù Ed Yong writes.

Every cup of coffee (more insulin), every brisk walk (less insulin) turned into a math problem with serious consequences: Extremely high or low blood sugar can be fatal. The healthy pancreas does these ‚Äúcalculations‚Äù to adjust insulin automatically, and for decades researchers have worked toward creating an artificial pancreas that can do the same.

That‚Äôs when she noticed the rings. The lagoon is full of ‚Äúpatch reefs‚Äù‚Äîisolated chunks of coral that can be as small as a melon or can span acres. Regardless of size, these chunks are often encircled by barren rings of sand, which separate them from the algae and seagrass that lie further afield. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a teeming city on the reef and then when you move away, it‚Äôs like a desert,‚Äù says Madin. First described in the 1960s, the circles have since become known as grazing halos. The idea is that fish and sea urchins that live within the reefs gobble up anything that grows nearby, leaving bare sand behind. But these grazers are loathe to venture into the open, where they could be easily picked off by sharks, barracuda, snappers, and jacks. Their fear keeps them close to the reef, and their hunger keeps that zone free of greenery. Hence: grazing halos. But why are they there? Madin and her team have been studying what‚Äôs behind these halos in hopes that scientists could eventually use the halos to quickly assess the health of coral reefs, and the fish populations within them.

Not necessarily with force, but with the full weight of American influence. That was the Holbrooke doctrine, vindicated at Dayton, where he ended a war and brought an uneasy peace to Bosnia. The country owed its existence to the liberal internationalism of Pax Americana. Now that those words are history, and we‚Äôve retreated into a nationalism whose ugliness more and more reminds me of Balkan politics, we should revisit Bosnia to see what‚Äôs lost when America decides to leave the world alone.‚Äù\nRead more at the link in our bio. üì∑ : Bernard Bisson / Sygma / Getty, Luca Bruno / AP, David Brauchli / AP, William J.

They believe that animals are conscious beings that experience, in varying degrees, emotions analogous to human desire, fear, pain, sorrow, and joy.

Prospects for successful cooperation were inauspicious: a highly partisan atmosphere, significant divisions within each party, deep suspicions of the administration‚Äôs credibility, displeasure over George W. Bush‚Äôs indifferent record on regulating the financial-services industry, and a national election just six weeks away. And yet, remarkably, a political system widely castigated as dysfunctional proved capable of passing an enormously expensive, complex, and contentious piece of legislation that prevented a second Great Depression. As a senior aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, John Lawrence had an opportunity to witness both the unfolding of the crisis and the private discussions and negotiations that saved the American economy from the worst meltdown since the 1930s. And as a historian, he recorded on legal pads those private conversations as they unfolded, revealing the strategies, tensions, and interactions that allowed political rivals and adversaries to avoid the abyss. Those notes are now with the Library of Congress, and for the first time, Lawrence reveals those discussions and shares the untold story of how America‚Äôs political leaders crossed the aisle to stave off financial collapse in 2008.

As gay people fought the stereotype of brokenness, homosexual came to be seen as clinical and pathologizing. \"Gay,\" by contrast, had a long linguistic history and no pseudoscientific baggage. But the male and female homosexual populations differed in some ways, and so \"gay\" became gendered to complement \"lesbian.\" Meanwhile, as recognition grew that trans people faced discrimination and ignorance comparable to what homosexuals endured, the addition of ‚ÄúT‚Äù made gradual inroads. By 2007, when gay-rights advocates decided to make their support for a federal antidiscrimination bill conditional on the inclusion of protections for transgender people, it was clear that the gay-and-lesbian and trans movements had become politically joined at the hip; including the ‚ÄúT‚Äù made undeniable sense. Bisexual people, concerned that their issues would be overlooked, also sought acknowledgment, and their initial was stapled in too. And so the unwieldy four-letter acronym reigned. It had its advantages. It signaled factional inclusion to those inside the movement, and factional solidarity to those outside the movement. In that sense, it was good politics and good symbolism. But it wasn‚Äôt stable. Factionalism rarely is. As activists and theorists sought to cover every base, they recognized asexuality and intersexuality and various other identities by coining LGBTQIAA+,LGBTTIQQ2SA, and other telescoping designations.

In ancient Mesopotamia, Babylonian priests performed exorcisms by casting wax figurines of demons into a fire. The Hindu Vedas, thought to have been written between 1500 and 500 b.c., refer to supernatural beings‚Äîknown as asuras, but largely understood today as demons‚Äîthat challenge the gods and sabotage human affairs. For the ancient Greeks, too, demonlike creatures lurked on the shadowy fringes of the human world. But far from being confined to a past of Demiurges and evil eyes, belief in demonic possession is widespread in the United States today. Polls conducted in recent decades by Gallup and the data firm YouGov suggest that roughly half of Americans believe demonic possession is real. The percentage who believe in the devil is even higher, and in fact has been growing: Gallup polls show that the number rose from 55 percent in 1990 to 70 percent in 2007. Perhaps as a result, demand for exorcisms‚Äîthe Catholic Church‚Äôs antidote to demonic possession‚Äîseems to be growing as well. The inescapable question is: Why? Or rather: Why now? Why, in our modern age, are so many people turning to the Church for help in banishing incorporeal fiends from their body?

In a place still bound in many ways by the strictures of old Jim Crow, the changing demographics of a growing black and brown population meet the realities of a statewide carceral machine and widespread structural disenfranchisement.

What would Madison make of American democracy today, an era in which Jacksonian populism looks restrained by comparison? Madison‚Äôs worst fears of mob rule have been realized‚Äîand the cooling mechanisms he designed to slow down the formation of impetuous majorities have broken. During the election of 1912, the progressive populists Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson insisted that the president derived his authority directly from the people. Since then, the office has moved in precisely the direction the Founders had hoped to avoid: Presidents now make emotional appeals, communicate directly with voters, and pander to the mob. Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms have accelerated public discourse to warp speed, creating virtual versions of the mob.

Research on urban wildlife has already shown that cities can have jaw-dropping effects on animals‚Äô behavior. In several metropolitan areas, researchers have devised simple puzzles‚Äîusually difficult-to-open boxes of food‚Äîin order to compare the problem-solving abilities of city-dwelling creatures with those of their wild relatives. The results have been tantalizing: Urban animals as varied as Canadian raccoons and Barbadian bullfinches can outperform their rural counterparts. While it pays to be cunning in almost any setting, some scientists propose that foreign, volatile environments like cities demand an especially broad range of cognitive abilities. Eventually, the thinking goes, cities may bend evolution enough to make whole populations of animals within them smarter‚Äîif, of course, the animals can survive city life in the first place. Anya Ratnayaka has launched the first-ever study of urban fishing cats, identifying and tracking a small, scattered population of the animals in Colombo as they caper over roofs and wiggle through storm drains. As Ratnayaka considers how they may be adapting to this unlikely setting‚Äîand whether they‚Äôre doing so fast enough to make the city, which has been bulldozing its way into their natural habitat, a sustainable home‚Äîshe has stumbled into a provocative theory. Some scientists speculate that only the most intelligent members of a species can survive in a hazardous and ever-changing urban world. If so, cities may be making animals smarter than their rural counterparts.

However, the rapid growth vastly outpaced immediate demand and overwhelmed Chinese cities, where infrastructure and regulations were not prepared to handle a sudden flood of millions of shared bicycles. Riders would park bikes anywhere, or just abandon them, resulting in bicycles piling up and blocking already-crowded streets and pathways. As cities impounded derelict bikes by the thousands, they moved quickly to cap growth and regulate the industry. Vast piles of impounded, abandoned, and broken bicycles have become a familiar sight in many big cities. As some of the companies who jumped in too big and too early have begun to fold, their huge surplus of bicycles can be found collecting dust in vast vacant lots. Bike sharing remains very popular in China, and will likely continue to grow, just probably at a more sustainable rate.  In a few cases, plans have been announced to refurbish and distribute some of the bikes to smaller neighboring towns, in others, wholesale recycling has begun, and bicycles are being crushed into cubes. The scale of the situation was so large to begin with, it will be a long time before the bicycle graveyards fade away. üì∑: Jackal Pan / VCG via Getty / Aly Song / Reuters", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e6dc84234caf02ec3e803709b3868716/5E59E009/t51.2885-15/e35/c123.0.364.364a/39338940_675713969464605_7568734000580132864_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bml2-jCHTwh/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/28c047dc2bdd8c660f005a6e08e36cc8/5DBEF877/t51.2885-15/e15/c140.0.360.360a/38437786_1779797035473580_3964568656058253312_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BmjmRFTHwWx/", "caption": "The legendary soul singer, pianist, and performer Aretha Franklin died on Thursday, surrounded by family and friends, at the age of 76.

One morning this past September, Kiarra Boulware boarded the 26 bus to Baltimore‚Äôs Bon Secours Hospital, where she would seek help for the most urgent problem in her life: the 200-some excess pounds she carried on her 5-foot-2-inch frame. To Kiarra, the weight sometimes felt like a great burden, and at other times like just another fact of life. She had survived a childhood marred by death, drugs, and violence. She had recently gained control over her addiction to alcohol, which, last summer, had brought her to a residential recovery center in the city‚Äôs Sandtown neighborhood, made famous by the Freddie Gray protests in 2015. Over the course of nearly a year, Olga Khazan reported in Sandtown and other parts of Baltimore on issues of health in urban black communities. What she found in Kiarra‚Äôs struggle was the story of how one person‚Äôs efforts to get better‚Äîimperfect as they may have been‚Äîwere made vastly more difficult by a daunting series of obstacles. But it is also a bigger story, of how African Americans became stuck in profoundly unhealthy neighborhoods, and of how the legacy of racism can literally take years off their lives. Far from being a relic of the past, America‚Äôs racist and segregationist history continues to harm black people in the most intimate of ways‚Äîseeping into their lungs, their blood, even their DNA.

For the last five years, small groups of people have made this drive and moved into the dome, known as a habitat. Their job is to pretend that they really are on Mars, and then spend months living like it. The goal, for the researchers who send them there, is to figure out how human beings would do on a mission to the real thing. In February of this year, the latest batch of pioneers, a crew of four, made the journey up the mountain. They settled in for an eight-month stay. Four days later, one of them was taken away on a stretcher and hospitalized. The remaining crew members were evacuated by mission support. All four eventually returned to the habitat, not to continue their mission, but to pack up their stuff. Their simulation was over for good. The little white dome has remained empty since, and the University of Hawaii, which runs the program, and NASA, which funds it, are investigating the incident that derailed the mission.

But these athletes may not have the answers to turn readers into the runners they aspire to be. They might just be outliers.

Genius, a male condition that inflects its maleness on the individual soul. Genius, an object of worship. Genius, perhaps slightly demonic.

What is striking, though, is that, millennia later, the biases of the language remain with us, tugging at the edges.

Women on bicycles were pelted with objects and obscenities. These unchaperoned women, some people worried, could be pedaling away to engage in prostitution or lesbianism. The pivotal period for women‚Äôs cycling clothing was the 1890s cycling craze, when the standard modern bike (the ‚Äúsafety bicycle‚Äù) became trendy. As part of the rational dress movement, which sought to make the conventional clothing of the Victorian era more comfortable, cycling helped to highlight the utter impracticality of corsets.

In his era, writes Andrew Cherlin, a young couple usually got married first, then moved in together, then started their adult roles as workers or homemakers, and then had children. These days, marriage tends to come after most of these markers are attained.

Only two months into his tenure, Warren had presided over oral arguments in the blockbuster school-segregation case Brown v. Board of Education. As of the dinner, the case was still under advisement. Yet Eisenhower seated Warren near one of the attorneys who had argued the case for the southern states, John W. Davis, and went out of his way to praise Davis as a great man.

She scans the docket of 30 scheduled arraignments and asks promising candidates whether or not they have secure housing. What the circumstances were behind their arrest. What headspace they are in now. Not all people get to the face-to-face meeting, but those who do have a chance to argue that they should be helped. And Whiteside must then decide whether or not to pay their bail. Whiteside is a charitable bail fund agent in the Bronx. She pays bail for some New Yorkers who can‚Äôt afford to pay it themselves, as part of a program that may seem counterintuitive. The Liberty Fund, created by the City of New York, sets free some of the very people that the city‚Äôs municipal judges have deemed a flight risk. But the fund, which actually relies on money from a private donor for the bail costs, is one of several initiatives by the city to disassemble the bail system from the inside.

Official high-school graduation statistics for Pine Ridge are hard to come by, but one official estimated that, for every 100 children who enter kindergarten, just 30 will get their high-school diplomas. Native youth, in general, have the lowest high-school graduation rate of students across all schools, and the graduation rate for Native Americans in South Dakota is roughly 50 percent. Finding a decent-paying job can be challenging even for the small percentage of kids who do manage to get their high-school degrees. Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a local nonprofit, strives to fill in the gaps for these non-college-bound young people and to empower Lakota families with a grassroots approach. Working in seven core themes, from language revival to food sovereignty, Thunder Valley steps in where, and when, schools fall short.

For 20 years, it had been hiring the greats of modernism to erect buildings where scientists and salespeople could work shoulder-to-shoulder commanding the burgeoning computer industry. But that year, one of its new facilities‚Äîthe Santa Teresa Laboratory, in Silicon Valley‚Äîtried an experiment. To ease a logjam at the office mainframe, it installed boxy, green-screened terminals in the homes of five employees, allowing them to work from home.‚Äã ‚ÄãThe idea of telecommuting was still a novelty. But this little solution seemed effective. By 1983, about 2,000 IBMers were working remotely. The corporation eventually realized that it could save millions by selling its signature buildings and institutionalizing distance work; the number of remote workers ballooned. In 2009, an IBM report boasted that ‚Äú40 percent of IBM‚Äôs some 386,000 employees in 173 countries have no office at all.‚Äù More than 58 million square feet of office space had been unloaded, at a gain of nearly $2 billion. IBM, moreover, wanted to help other corporations reap the same officeless efficiencies through its consulting services.

Winds made of gas particles whip around galaxies at high speeds. Sometimes, these winds get recycled when they are ejected out of galaxies into intergalactic space, and then sucked back in.\n\nDaniel Angl√©s-Alc√°zar, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University in Illinois, and his colleagues recently decided to study the process behind wind recycling. They plugged a bunch of data into computer simulations of galaxy formations, ready to compare their results with previous models. They got a big surprise instead. \nThe simulations showed that supernovae, the explosions of dying stars, can produce winds of gas that can escape their parent galaxy, travel for billions of years across intergalactic space, and become absorbed into a different galaxy, where the newly arrived atoms may form new stars. The simulations demonstrated that gas flows from smaller galaxies to larger galaxies, like the Milky Way.

And they frequently have done just that, according to Forman, a former public defender in Washington, D.C.; a co-founder of a D.C. charter school for at-risk youth; and now a professor at Yale Law School. Using the District of Columbia (a‚Ääk‚Ääa ‚ÄòChocolate City‚Äô) as his laboratory, Forman documents how, as crime rose from the late 1960s to the ‚Äô90s, the city‚Äôs African American residents responded by supporting an array of tough-on-crime measures. A 1975 measure decriminalizing marijuana died in the majority-black city council, which went on to implement one of the nation‚Äôs most stringent gun-control laws. Black residents endorsed a ballot initiative that called for imposing harsh sentences on drug dealers and violent offenders. Replicated on a national level over the same period, these policies led to mass incarceration and aggressive policing strategies like stop-and-frisk, developments that are now looked upon as affronts to racial justice.‚Äù Paul Butler writes about how inner-city support for law-and-order policies grew as crime rose from the late ‚Äò60s to the ‚Äò90s in our June issue.

One is a more empirical, medical model of disease based on objective sets of diagnostic criteria, labels, and standardized treatment approaches. The other is a more individualistic approach in which every case is unique, and the practice is entirely reliant on diagnostic insights and expert opinions that can only come from one-on-one interviews.\n\nThe latter approach has posed problems of legitimacy for the field throughout the years. In studies of people who are seen by more than one psychiatrist, the consistency of the diagnosis varies. One may consider you depressed and suggest a serotonin-modulating pill, while another may say no such thing. This degree of variation is less common in other medical specialties, as is the basic fact that few objective standards exist by which any given psychiatrist‚Äôs diagnosis can be proven right or wrong.\n\nStill, many in psychiatry have formally and forcefully resisted a move toward using concrete metrics to make diagnoses. ‚ÄãAnd t‚Äãhis makes the question of neutral or impartial experts difficult‚Äã. ‚Äã\n\nA debate on the nature of expertise in mental health could decide three people‚Äôs lives, and many more to come.

The Reagan administration reacted with fury at what it perceived as Mexican indifference to Camarena‚Äôs disappearance, all but shutting down the border for about a week. \nThe grandiose promise of trade is that it binds countries together, breeding peace and cooperation.

A commitment to working out suggests self-control, discipline, and a willingness to exert oneself in pursuit of a goal‚Äîideas that align with the good old-fashioned American belief in meritocracy, however illusory.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, then, upon taking office, many recent presidents had special fitness-related requests and routines. Courted by two NFL teams while in college, Gerald Ford maintained his fitness in office with daily swims in the pool he had built on the White House grounds. A baseball player in his youth, George H.W. Bush dabbled in all kinds of sports as president, particularly running. Bill Clinton installed a jogging track on the South Lawn but preferred to run outside the White House gates, much to the chagrin of the Secret Service (admittedly, he ended more than one run at McDonald‚Äôs). George W. Bush liked mountain biking and was another avid runner, going so far as to put a treadmill on Air Force One so he‚Äôd never have to skip a workout.\n\nThen there was Barack Obama, who started most days with a 45-minute weights-and-cardio session. In 2009, the 44th president had hoops and basketball lines added to the tennis court at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and regularly invited friends, and even former NBA players, to informal scrimmages. Exercise was not his only healthy habit. A famously disciplined eater, Obama managed to lose a few pounds while doing perhaps the world‚Äôs most demanding job. Whether he completely kicked a decades-long smoking habit has been debated, but he‚Äôs said to have transformed the health of others in the White House for the better, stocking the building with healthy food, encouraging staffers to participate in group fitness challenges, and offering the services of his own personal trainer.\n\nUnlike George W. Bush and Barack Obama before him, Trump doesn‚Äôt seem to care about working out or eating healthy. ‚ÄãRead more from \"The Unfit President,\" by Stephanie Hayes, online now.‚Äã üé®‚Äã: Michelle Kondrich\n\n#president #trump # health‚Äã", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/cacb9a58778b93af68730ac74df54459/5E4822CF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c99.0.882.882a/s640x640/17495347_1320397858044639_1165745087246761984_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BSbRuk6Dvv5/", "caption": "From our friends @citylab: Is it possible to visualize the changing character of a city in one image?

These laws arose from a flurry of legislating‚Äînearly all emerged in the same two-year period‚Äîand they had astonishingly large goals. They sought to restrict toxic air pollution nationwide, clean up hundreds of streams and rivers, and erect a permanent, federally empowered Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nHere is the most astonishing thing about these laws: They worked. Although they contained flaws, the laws accomplished their goals with greater success than critics predicted; and their rules cost businesses less money to implement than even hopeful supporters forecast.\n\nThe laws remain in place today, though the EPA still bickers with various industries over their scope. EPA employees consult the most recent science about conventional air or water pollution, formulate rules to protect the public from those dangers, and turn them into law. The American public benefits from this process, according to most research; and a large majority of Americans tell pollsters that they approve of it. The system seems to work.\n\nOr, at least, it worked. The Trump administration has indicated‚Äîthrough its proposed budget and through its choice of appointees‚Äîthat it cannot abide the status quo. Its proposed budget cuts billions from the agency‚Äôs budget, and it has begun the process of rescinding years of Obama-era regulatory work.\n\nMany Americans are now looking anew at the environmental policy machine running in the background of the government.

I‚Äôm @MattEich, and I‚Äôm a portrait photographer and photographic essayist based in Charlottesville, VA. I‚Äôll be sharing a selection of images from my contribution to The Atlantic‚Äôs #AmericansatWork project. First, some background: When we met in 2005, I was 19 and Melissa was 18. I was a sophomore studying photojournalism and she was a freshman pursuing early childhood education. She has been my best friend ‚Äî and muse ‚Äî ever since. Fast-forward 11 years: We are now 30 and 29. I work as a freelance photographer and my wife is a speech-language pathologist. We have two children, ages nine and four. Like many couples, we part ways each morning with little knowledge of our partner‚Äôs day. For The Atlantic‚Äôs project, I proposed something close to home. Instead of documenting the work/life balance of a stranger, I wanted to better understand how my wife managed her work/life balance. On an average day, Melissa is up before the sun, her alarm set for 5:18AM. Some mornings, her alarm does not even go off, she just shoots out of bed in a panic at 5:15AM. I bury myself deeper in the sheets while she dresses in the dark. She cherishes this quiet period; she reads, gathers her thoughts, and caffeinates. By 6:15AM the kids are up, and the morning ritual of getting them dressed and out the door commences.

The only time he spoke came at some point in the 1990s, when he was surprised by a hiker during a walk. ‚Äã'‚ÄãHi,‚Äã'‚Äã Knight said.

People today have ‚Äã'‚Äãthoroughly domesticated themselves,‚Äã'‚Äã he told me. Early humans, by contrast, had to be much more inventive, adept at problem-solving, and subtly attuned to changes in the natural environment. Their need to cooperate made them socially connected, as people nowadays are desperate to be (‚ÄúThink Facebook,‚Äù he says). Early humans may even have been smarter than us: Cro-Magnons had larger brains than we do today. (Some scientists believe our ancestors needed extra brainpower to negotiate tough environmental challenges. Others c‚Äã‚Äãonnect the decline to an overall decrease in body mass since the end of the last ice age.) Above and beyond its applications to his scholarly work, Schindler says that his mastery of early-human technologies has given him a sense of personal competence. He believes that our overdependence on technologies we don‚Äôt fully understand and are incapable of creating is disempowering. ‚Äã'‚ÄãThe true value of all this is not trying to live a prehistoric life,‚Äã'‚Äã he told me. ‚Äã'‚ÄãIt‚Äôs applying what we learn from the past to address contemporary problems.‚Äã'‚Äã For example: how to be healthy and happy. Ancient peoples faced dangers, he points out, but little routine emotional stress, and few of the chronic illnesses that arise from poor diet and lack of physical activity. They can also teach us a lot about how to interact with the natural world, he says. ‚Äã'‚ÄãIn the past, when people killed too many animals or overharvested plants, they saw the impact on the world,‚Äã'‚Äã Schindler told me.

It‚Äôs a dilemma as old as democracy itself.\nTwenty-four centuries ago, Athens was upended by the outcome of a vote that is worth revisiting today. A war-weary citizenry, raised on democratic exceptionalism but disillusioned by its leaders, wanted to feel great again‚Äîa recipe for unease and raw vindictiveness, then as now. The populace had no strongman to turn to, ready with promises that the polis would soon be winning, winning like never before. But hanging around the agora, volubly engaging residents of every rank, was someone to turn on: Socrates, whose provocative questioning of the city-state‚Äôs sense of moral superiority no longer seemed as entertaining as it had in more secure times. Athenians were in no mood to have their views shaken up. They had lost patience with the lively, discomfiting debates sparked by the old man. In 399 b.c., accused of impiety and corrupting the young, Socrates stood trial before a jury of his peers‚Äîone of the great pillars of Athenian democracy. That spring day, the 501 citizen-jurors did not do the institution proud.

I'll be sharing images over the next two days from my recent photo essay documenting caregivers at work in eastern Massachusetts, both in their offices and in the homes of the elderly clients they serve, as part of The Atlantic's 'Americans at Work' project. My goal in pursuing this project was to highlight the importance of elderly care and the challenges faced by both the elderly and their caregivers, challenges that are so often overlooked within a society that tends to be centered around its youth. Pictured here, Dimitrinka Pesheva (left), a home care aide, comforts 101-year-old Ida Kachanov in Kachanov's apartment in Brookline, Massachusetts, on December 2, 2016. Since 1983, Kachanov has been receiving services through Springwell, a non-profit organization that has been creating, managing, and coordinating services for the elderly and disabled in the greater Boston, Massachusetts area for more than 35 years. Pesheva works at one of Springwell's vendor agencies and spends her shifts with Kachanov doing anything she might need, including cooking, feeding, cleaning, bathing, dressing, or simply providing comfort and companionship. She has been working with Kachanov for the past three years. When Pesheva first started working with Kachanov, Kachanov was able to get around using a walker and could feed herself. Now, Kachanov is bedridden and needs 24-hour care. She is often confused and frustrated, and refers to Pesheva as \"Mama,\" calling for Pesheva many times throughout her shift to come to her side and hold her hand.

A lifelong Michigander, I moved to Texas just over a year ago after working for over a decade in Detroit. For the next couple days, I will be sharing my photo essay, part of The Atlantic‚Äôs Americans at Work series, on the NorthWest Bible Church‚Äôs Between the Jobs Ministry in Spring, Texas. Having covered the downturn in the auto industry while in Detroit, I was noticing some similarities with the oil and gas industry when I moved to Houston. While the nation has been enjoying the benefits of cheaper gas at the pump, oil-producing states have seen the negative effects. The latest numbers from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that between October 2014 and May 2016, there has been a decline in oil and gas employment of 26 percent. Most of the people who lost their jobs were white-collar and considered upper middle class. For more than 20 years, the NorthWest Bible Church in Spring, Texas, an outlying suburb of Houston, has been hosting a Between Jobs Ministry. People from all ages and walks of life are welcomed to learn interviewing and r√©sum√© skills, find encouragement and a lot of faith that they can get through this difficult time. Every Wednesday, the church‚Äôs parking lot overflows with newer, well-maintained vehicles driven by job seekers, many of whom are in this position for the first time in their lives.\n\n#texas #jobs #ministry", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f43775122f5ac74adb683cc3d0a93d9c/5E526250/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c198.0.683.683a/s640x640/16228530_189414964871941_771194582388965376_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BP_JhD_AoqK/", "caption": "‚ÄãOlga Khazan writes about how #conservatives are more likely to support issues like ‚Äã#immigration and ‚Äã#Obamacare if the message is ‚Äúmorally reframed‚Äù to suit their values‚Äã in \"The Simple Psychological Trick to Political Persuasion.\" üé®: Peter Frederick Rothermel / Library of Congress / Zak Bickel / The Atlantic", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/065d0ea9e92dfe4ad6f9d1f84ca16a28/5E481140/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c181.0.718.718a/s640x640/16123958_287958728287665_1041865985478361088_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BP-3qgHAoHB/", "caption": "Maybe it‚Äôs #Putin‚Äôs world, and we‚Äôre all just living in it.

They don‚Äôt own a refrigerator or a car; their year-old baby and four-year-old toddler play by candlelight rather than electricity at night. They identify as Christian anarchists, and have given an official name to their search for an alternative to consumption-heavy American life: the Downstream Project, with the motto to ‚Äúdo unto those downstream as you would have those upstream do unto you.‚Äù As it turns out, exiting the system is a challenging, time-consuming, and surprisingly technical process. Here in the Shenandoahs and central Virginia, a handful of tiny communities are experimenting with what it means to reject the norms of contemporary life and exist in a radically different way. They seem to share Americans‚Äô pervasive sense of political alienation, which arguably reached an apotheosis with the election of Donald Trump: a sense of division from their peers, a distrust of government. The challenges of modern politics‚Äîdealing with issues like climate change, poverty, mass migration, and war on a global scale‚Äîare so vast and abstract that it‚Äôs difficult not to find them overwhelming.

Among men (but not women) who voted for a losing candidate, testosterone plummeted once the election was called, to a degree expected of actual contestants in a competition, rather than vicarious participants.‚Äã\" Ben Rowan's \"How Voters Respond to Electoral Defeat‚Äã,\" from the November issue, online now. üé®: James Walton\n\n#election #voting #defeat #politics #happiness‚Äã", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/944556c50e3ff51724454ac10f85b518/5E5BCCA7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/14723189_1760470080858402_875542943149064192_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BLrURLpgqVh/", "caption": "‚ÄãEmma Green writes about how t‚Äãhe misogyny of the 2016 campaign has stifled critiques of Clinton from progressive feminists and people of color‚Äã in \"Women Who Hate Trump, but Aren‚Äôt With Her‚Äã.\" üé®: Justin Sullivan / Getty‚Äã /‚Äã‚Äã ‚ÄãPaul Spella / The Atlantic ‚Äã#hillaryclinton #feminism #election2016 #intersectionality‚Äã", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/105b5d2f1b62112c6a9d7e342ea09715/5E541421/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c181.0.718.718a/s640x640/14676633_1764325697155291_6465199985607573504_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BLqlm4CAde6/", "caption": "Sage, Ink: Standing By Their Man. üé®: Sage Stossel.

Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant.\n\nFear pervades Americans‚Äô lives‚Äîand American politics.

Both Republicans and Democrats have advanced legislation to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenses. The troubling economics of incarceration, aggressive policing in poor communities, and the wide-ranging discretion of prosecutors are all coming under scrutiny. But strangely absent from this discussion is the role of public defenders. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a fatal omission,‚Äù said Jonathan Rapping, president and founder of the advocacy organization Gideon‚Äôs Promise. ‚ÄúIf we believe in equal justice, then the single most important thing to do is make sure poor people have the kinds of lawyers richer people would have.‚Äù The right to legal counsel has long been the gold standard of American justice under the Constitution.

She always hears the birds when she wakes. It must be late, she thinks. She stretches her arms overhead. Her son, Marco, sleeps soundly beside her. They were both up most of the night because Marco had a fever, but it's gone now. She kisses Marco's forehead, smooth likes his father's. \nGraciela's husband, Hector, died a little over five months ago. He was hit by a car while he was riding his bike to work. Graciela still can't wrap her head around kissing him goodbye at 7am and then learning he was dead at 9am. That didn't make sense to her. For a few weeks, she simply wished it away. Then she pretended that Hector was somewhere else, somewhere she could keep him safe. \nGraciela insisted on a closed casket funeral because she didn't want to see Hector's eyes closed and his hands neatly folded across his chest. That was too horrible to imagine. \nDuring those first weeks after Hector died, Marco clung to her, and she welcomed his soft little body against hers. He would spend minutes at a time gazing deeply into her eyes, his hands cupped against her cheeks.\n\nIt is in this way she told him about his father, in these silent moments. This is how she came to understand and accept that her husband was dead.\n\n#atlanticamericandream \n#flashfiction \n#crashes\n#storytelling\n#grief\n#acceptance\n#narrative\n#prose", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f034c43d8e3b6e7b63fdf831378fe0c5/5E5C0458/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/11899469_897080900382868_542717247_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/6xSPZbkE8O/", "caption": "Here's a beautiful #atlanticamericandream #repost from @mindys_maps. „Éª„Éª„Éª\n\"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes\" Marcel Proust", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d6467827f63099e1232be9e213cc3c64/5E592FD4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/11856673_351903954980270_1069712358_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/6p6NvOEE_G/", "caption": "Hello @annieflanagan, we'd love to hear about your American Dreamer #Repost „Éª„Éª„Éª\ni remember running though the wet grass, falling a step behind / Columbus OH, 2015 #incrediblemaniacs #summer #ohio #swim #AtlanticAmericanDream", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a3d5fab4b440d80251089f4fb822609f/5E51E102/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/11349411_692556324209497_819340339_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/6pf5qsEE1b/", "caption": "Hello @kalbs17, tell us about your #AtlanticAmericanDream #Repost „Éª„Éª„Éª\nWhen I walk up to the produce section it's like angels start singing.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ef1a21bbc7c324519e3930850fcc6743/5E56A835/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/11363889_870447936372756_2060000485_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/6nlSMzEE51/", "caption": "Another interesting interpretation for the #atlanticamericandream project. #Repost from @manhattanadam\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\n#AtlanticAmericanDream #nyc", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d5891905094af00cf03032eba291ce58/5E40810B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/11821672_1626545230949015_1598973438_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/6nHi6WEE4D/", "caption": "An #AtlanticAmericanDream from @hsm_photo_graphy #repost\n„Éª„Éª„Éª\nBay bridge.
