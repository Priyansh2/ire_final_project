In the '80s, other types of manufacturing started to emerge, and today the vibrant arts scene is revitalizing the Southern city of 68,000, attracting other artists, young professionals and families wanting a fun, affordable place to live.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThe campaign to make Greenville into a cool city‚Äîthe next Portland, Ore.‚Äîbegan in 2012 and is centered around the catchphrase \"Yeah, that,\" as in yes, the Greenville in South Carolina as opposed to some 36 other towns named Greenville across the United States. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nWhat makes the city different is that many of the newly arrived artists are already established‚Äînot stereotypically young and starving. Because of that, the newcomers are buying high-end homes and building studios. Average home prices have risen in the city over 20% in the past three years, and the number of homes priced $1 million and over has almost tripled during that time.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nRead more at the link in our bio. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nüì∑: Danielle Paul for @wsjrealestate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3e408567fb38096cf9ba8b59c752f809/5E54D358/t51.2885-15/e35/c142.0.568.568a/46367419_282761042431519_4104454654094138280_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BrWJW9wgcMx/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e68f0d1ea3358aae9b2235308e6acfdf/5DC0F802/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/47585828_216526845924820_6529271103729170897_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BrToeFkg54x/", "caption": "Michael Cohen, President Trump's longtime fixer and personal lawyer, arrived at federal court in New York City Wednesday before being sentenced to three years in prison.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nMr. Cohen had pleaded guilty in recent months to nine felony counts, including two campaign-finance violations related to payments he arranged during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence two women who said they had sexual encounters with Mr. Trump.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nShortly after Mr. Cohen's sentencing, prosecutors publicly disclosed that American Media, Inc., the National Enquirer‚Äôs parent company, had also admitted to its role in one of those illegal payments, as was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThe company said the purpose of its $150,000 payment to a former Playboy model in August 2016 was to quash her story of an affair with Mr. Trump to prevent it from influencing the 2016 election‚Äînot for legitimate editorial reasons, as the company previously said.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nRead more at the link in our bio. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nüì∑: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters‚†Ä\n‚†Ä", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c9862fcd260b44b2fa8e7fcdadd8ed64/5E41A1AF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47305513_1033504680154262_5552890626706822417_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BrQ_6ktAwZl/", "caption": "On a recent morning in Rockford, Ill., homeless advocates Alex Keedi and Angie Walker went on a weekly sweep looking for homeless people and encountered Mark Bradley on a mattress under a bridge.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThe pair gave the 55-year-old a card with housing program information, and his eyes silently welled with tears as he recounted his struggles with mental illness. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\n\"I would not be opposed to anything that gets me out of here,\" Mr. Bradley said, after Mr. Keedi asked if he would be open to living in a high-rise for disabled seniors.‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nRockford, about 90 miles northwest of Chicago, is one of the first cities to effectively end homelessness among veterans, according to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

In this case, the original owner had a Swiss firm build the body. The end result was a 22-foot-long car with an equally impressive 16-cylinder engine. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nThe vehicle was essentially left to rot for years following World War II, and Mr. Patterson believes it was imported to the U.S. in the late 1960s and underwent some restoration. It was kept in the @blackhawkmuseum in Danville, Calif., until it came up for sale three years ago. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nHe immediately began a full restoration after buying it, and a tremendous amount of research has gone into finding out what the original looked like. Mr. Patterson found a former worker for General Motors who remembered seeing the car when it was first brought to the U.S. ‚†Ä\n‚†Ä\nPrivately, he has shown the Cadillac to friends in the car business.

It was like hopping back in time. Camels lumbered through the city, houses made of mud. At night, most of the light came from candles. People got around on donkeys. It was like a scene from the Old Testament. It certainly wasn't a place plugged into the global economy: There wasn't a single ATM. Officials told me there were only two banks and maybe five places, total, to send money, Western Union-style back then. So you can imagine my surprise when I returned, this month, to see how a gush of migrants passing through here to Europe has enriched the town. There are 14 banks ‚Äì and countless more money sending shops. Mud brick homes are being replaced by rising cement villas, lighted by solar power, not candles. Everywhere there is evidence of migrant money: I didn't see a camel the entire time.
