Domestically Trump has increased the national debt by $3 Trillion and the federal budget deficit to $1 Trillion. 10 of the worst point drops in the history of the DJIA have happened on Trump's watch. The longest government shutdown in American history was caused by Trump (35 days). Trump is now the first president since Andrew Johnson in 1867 to face impeachment in his first term. Trump cannot maintain a working cabinet as the resignations have caused him to have the highest turnover rate of any president. The only credit I can give Trump is that he has destroyed the GOP. In 2017 the Democrats picked up a Senate seat in Alabama. In 2018 37 Republicans in the House of Representatives retired (the largest number of GOP retirements in history). The Democrats gained 40 House seats, 7 governorships and 334 state legislative seats. 23 Democrats were also elected or re-elected to the Senate with comfortable 6 year terms. For 2020 at least 17 Republicans in the House have announced their retirements while the GOP is playing defense in 22 Senate seats and the Dems only have to worry about 12."}, {"author": "regular3.14159", "comment": "Hey if you're interested in seeing what the U.S citizenship test is like, check out my story!

In 1989, the Court upheld restrictions on abortion passed by the Missouri legislature. Then President George H. W. Bush made two additional appointments. When the Court took up another abortion case during the term ending in 1992, many people expected that it would overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nIt didn‚Äôt. Instead, three of the justices appointed by Reagan and Bush ‚Äî Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O‚ÄôConnor, and David Souter ‚Äî wrote an opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey that reaffirmed Roe while also modifying it.\n\nPro-lifers were on the defensive in the run-up to the decision. Public support for legal abortion was rising. Previously pro-life politicians declared that they had undergone a change of heart. Pundits explained that if Roe was overturned, a sleeping pro-choice majority would awaken. Republican politicians would be placed in an impossible position. Their pro-life supporters would expect real action against abortion with the Supreme Court out of the way, but the Republicans could not deliver on those promises without a public backlash.\n\nThat political backdrop, it has often been suggested, played a role in the outcome of Casey.

Time goes on . His kids start having kids , he's got grandchildren now . He sees how the libs are tearing down the country. He supports McCain then Mitt . He sees both of them take a dive . Weak weak candidates . In true trump fashion he believes he can do it better . NO reason for him to run if he is a true lib ...

Back then the democrats a conservative wing and as they tried to quiet the conservatives Reagan felt the party let him down. Trump on the other jabs just 8 years ago supported Hillary, and I don't care why he did but he did. Just recently he supported Pelosi and Reid. That is why I don't trust him. It's funny how Rubio can't be forgiven for the gang of eight fiasco and now he is labeled establishment although he had a 96+ % conservative voting record, but in told to look the other way when I see trumps liberal past.

I understand why you posted such a misleading graphic, as I stated, I'm a journalist as well; I know game.

Domestically Trump has increased the national debt by $3 Trillion and the federal budget deficit to $1 Trillion. 10 of the worst point drops in the history of the DJIA have happened on Trump's watch. The longest government shutdown in American history was caused by Trump (35 days). Trump is now the first president since Andrew Johnson in 1867 to face impeachment in his first term. Trump cannot maintain a working cabinet as the resignations have caused him to have the highest turnover rate of any president. The only credit I can give Trump is that he has destroyed the GOP. In 2017 the Democrats picked up a Senate seat in Alabama. In 2018 37 Republicans in the House of Representatives retired (the largest number of GOP retirements in history). The Democrats gained 40 House seats, 7 governorships and 334 state legislative seats. 23 Democrats were also elected or re-elected to the Senate with comfortable 6 year terms. For 2020 at least 17 Republicans in the House have announced their retirements while the GOP is playing defense in 22 Senate seats and the Dems only have to worry about 12."}], "caption": "No matter how well your weekend went, you didn‚Äôt have as good of a weekend as President Trump.

There is no possible way to win an entire war from the air. It has never and will never happen. Partisan fighters would be a major problem in North Korea, and you can't effectively counter them with nothing but airpower. We tried in Vietnam and failed miserably. Even with stuff like Tropic Moon, we couldn't stop the flow of supplies over the Ho Chi Minh trail. In urban fighting, the only way to win that from the air is by leveling entire cities, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians. You can't make accurate strikes in a city like Pyongyang when everyone and their grandmother is holed up in an apartment harboring as many troops as they can fit. North Korea has an extensive network of tunnels that no country on Earth could clear from the air except through nuclear bunker busters. That's the sort of thing we faced in the early strikes on Afghanistan, which failed. We would need ground troops, 100%. There would be no way to win from the air whatsoever. Sure, we could weaken them deeply, but they wouldn't give up after some bombing raids or after their air force is gone. The North Korean psyche is dedicated to sacrificing their life to preserve the nation.
