In 2013, a group of professional scientists and amateur tinkerers founded @counterculturelabs with the goal of bringing biotechnology to the masses. At any time, it hosts dozens of projects. The Open Insulin Project has bigger plans. The group wants to reverse engineer how the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies produce insulin and then turn over the instructions to the public. In theory, anyone with a bit of cash could then build a #DIY lab in their garage and make open-source insulin. Currently, three companies control most of the world’s $27 billion insulin market, using a complicated web of regulations and patents to keep a hold on it. Open Insulin wants to rebuild it with no mega­corporations and no profit. In this photograph is its lead scientist, the 33-year-old French biochemist Yann Huon de Kermadec. The project is probably months, if not years, away from actually making medical-grade insulin, but its objective is as much political as it is production-oriented: bringing a sharp focus to the stratospheric price of insulin and, more broadly, the predatory pricing of prescription drugs in the U.S. Read more at the link in bio.

These engineered conditions led some to deemphasize the importance of the event.

We work for different reporting chains, we have different rules. They don’t really have rules on the opinion side. They can say whatever they want. If it’s their opinion. I don’t really watch a lot of opinion programming. I’m busy.” During his sign-off on Friday, Smith left his audience with this note: “Even in our currently polarized nation, it’s my hope that the facts will win the day, that the truth will always matter, that #journalism—and journalists—will thrive.” Read the full feature at the link in bio.

Now riding the crest of his fame, the 26-year-old is determined not to pull the ladder up behind him. Instead, he is dedicating himself to bringing greater visibility to a wider community of black musicians, artists and creators in #Britain. “There’s always been a kind of lack of spotlight and shine on the black British side of British culture,” he tells TIME. “[But] there’s a whole world of it … It’s a beautiful thing, and it’s coming of age right now.” Read more, and meet nine other young trailblazers who are shaping the world, at the link in bio.

But the next day, when he tried to eat so much as a single potato chip, he couldn’t keep it down. “He got weaker over the next few days and we came to realize his swallowing was paralyzed,” says his mother, Rachel. Eventually, the paralysis spread throughout Braden’s entire body below the neck, including his diaphragm, which meant he had to be intubated in order to breathe. He spent seven months in the hospital as the most acute phase of the disease receded and he received in-patient rehab. But even now that he’s home, his walking remains unsteady, paralysis continues in his left arm and his swallowing is still so poor he must be fed a liquid nutrient four times a day through a port in his stomach. Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)—a sudden inflammation of spinal tissue resulting in flaccid paralysis of the muscles of the limbs, neck, face and often diaphragm—is a lot like polio, but it’s not polio. It’s a little like meningitis and Guillain-Barré syndrome, but it’s not them either. Indeed, no one knows exactly what it is. For the moment it remains rare: In #America, where AFM is closely tracked, the disease attacks fewer than one in a million people even in peak years, and it very rarely kills. As with polio, AFM is seasonal—though unlike polio, it runs in an every-other-year cycle, peaking in even-numbered years.

By 2040, that gap is projected to rise to 355,000. In the absence of qualified professional caregivers, family members and friends must step in to help older loved ones with their daily living—often at great cost to their own financial and physical #health. It’s no small feat to craft a technological fix for this problem that is cost-effective, supports human care workers without taking their jobs, and reliably attends to the social, emotional and physical needs of aging people in a way that respects their dignity and privacy. But a starting point might look a lot like what’s happening right now at Knollwood Military Retirement Community, a 300-bed facility in northwest Washington, D.C. Focusing on the role artificial intelligence might play in eldercare, a handful of researchers—and socially assistive robot, Stevie—moved into Knollwood for months-long stretches this year.

In speeches, she says she remembers being surrounded by “a bunch of adults who spent all their time marching and shouting—for justice!” She was also on the front lines in her own way, writes @mollyesque. In 1970, when she entered first grade, Harris was in the second class of children to be bused across town to integrate an elementary school that had previously been 95% white. It was a 40-minute journey each way. She did not, at the time, understand that she was a pawn in grownups’ sociopolitical experimentation—a lack of trauma that, she jokes, presents a challenge in #politics. “People are like, ‘Tell us your suffering, tell us how hard it was,'” she says. “But I was raised by proud people. I was raised to know and believe we had everything we needed.” It’s easy to see how this upbringing shaped Harris’ standing as an outsider—someone who had to convince others she belonged, no matter where she was. But she was the kind of outsider who was determined to get inside. She was always trying to find commonalities, even as she was aware of the difficulty of making herself understood in different contexts. “The reality is that when you are the so-called minority,” she says, “you learn many languages, necessarily.” Read more at the link in bio.

While the junior Senator from #California and a top Democratic presidential candidate is in the competition for the nomination, she’s stuck in the mid–single digits in most national and early-state polls and draws modest crowds. In mid-September, Harris said she’d be focusing on the first-to-vote caucus state. Her campaign is doubling its staff in Iowa and she has pledged to visit every week for the foreseeable future. “I’m really excited about it,” she tells @mollyesque, saying the opportunity to engage in “old-school retail #politics” reminds her of her San Francisco political roots. “I like people.” People like Harris too; they just can’t quite place her. Like the acquaintance you recognize but can’t recall how you met, she seems both familiar and yet mysterious. Is she a liberal or a moderate, establishment or populist, reformer or radical? Critics point out that she has flip-flopped or obfuscated her positions on important policy issues, like #healthcare and #immigration, and the speeches she could use to define herself often devolve into paeans to unity. For all that, however, Harris remains in the hunt. She consistently polls among the top five candidates in the jumbled Democratic field, and she has the financial resources to remain viable. As more long-shot candidates bow out of the race, campaign officials expect Harris to benefit from voters’ renewed focus. With a little luck, they say, she still has a fairly clear path to the nomination. Read more at the link in bio.

The summary, which is not a “verbatim transcript” but rather a collection of “notes and recollections” from staffers listening to the call, comes after a whistleblower in the U.S. intelligence community filed a complaint in August regarding the conversation. The whistleblower was reportedly concerned that #Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate @joebiden. Trump and others in his orbit have alleged without evidence that, while he was Vice President, Biden blocked Ukrainian officials from investigating his son Hunter’s business activities in the country. Trump has confirmed speaking to Zelensky about Biden, but denied pressuring the Ukrainian leader by threatening to deny his country aid. “I didn’t threaten anybody,” Trump told reporters in New York on Wednesday.

Warren outlined a plan to curb the influence of corporate money in Washington. She proposed a lifetime ban on lobbying for ex-Presidents, Senators and members of Congress; a ban on hiring corporate lobbyists on federal government staff; a ban on lobbying on behalf of foreign governments; a ban on corporate lobbyists “bundling” campaign donations; a ban on secret meetings between public officials and lobbyists; and a ban on elected officials owning businesses or trading individual stocks. It came as no surprise that Warren, who has been railing against corruption since her time as a @harvardlaw professor, seized on the theme. But if the policy was familiar, the narrative was new.

The Karipuna tribe roamed one enclave, in what today is the Brazilian state of Rondônia. The European colonization of the Americas from 1492 saw settler plantations advance across the New World, bringing #deforestation on a vast scale for farmland, firewood and houses. As with many of the more than 300 tribes that survive in #Brazil, contact­ with outsiders decimated the Karipuna’s numbers through illnesses such as measles and flu. The 20th century arrival of outsiders spelled further tragedy. The government sent an expedition in 1976 to find and assimilate the tribespeople, who reacted joyfully at the moment of contact. The delight did not last. Over the following months and years, members would die after being exposed to new illnesses. The survivors tried to flee into the forest, but only eight survived. In 1998, the few surviving Karipuna were granted a protected territory about the size of New York City. #Indigenous land makes up 23% of the Brazilian Amazon and is a bulwark against deforestation. It binds the tribes to the fate of the forest, writes @themattsandy. If one dies, the other likely will too.

Scientists warn that decades of human activity and a changing climate has brought the jungle near a “tipping point.” The rain forest is so-called because it’s such a wet place, where the trees pull up water from the earth that then gathers in the atmosphere to become rain. That balance is upended by #deforestation, forest fires and global temperature rises. Experts warn that soon the water cycle will become irreversibly broken, locking in a trend of declining rainfall and longer dry seasons that began decades ago. At least half of the shrinking forest will give way to savanna, @themattsandy writes. With as much as 17% of the forest lost already, scientists believe that the tipping point will be reached at 20% to 25% of deforestation even if #climatechange is tamed. If, as predicted, global temperatures rise by 4°C, much of the central, eastern and southern Amazon will certainly become barren scrubland.

For those on Capitol Hill in #Washington, D.C., recalling the attacks carries a special poignancy—as congressional leaders, members and staff today wonder whether their lives were saved by the brave passengers and crew aboard United Airlines Flight 93, who stormed the cockpit and forced their hijacked plane to crash outside Shanksville, Pa. To this day, no one knows where Flight 93 might have struck. Morning meetings were interrupted by an alert that an emergency situation was unfolding in New York City—sketchy initial reports grew worse almost by the minute as the morning’s news unfolded from 8:46 a.m., when the first airliner in New York struck the North Tower. Staffers, representatives and senators quickly realized that what appeared to start as a tragic accident in New York was spreading into their own backyard—and that they themselves might be a target underneath the dome of the U.S. Capitol. Garrett M. Graff’s new book, \"The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11,\" is based on transcripts of official oral histories, conducted by both the U.S. House historian’s office and C-SPAN, as well as original interviews by the author and other primary source materials.

As #Trump embraced the idea of meeting with two of America’s most ardent adversaries—Taliban negotiators at Camp David, and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York later this month—Bolton objected increasingly vocally, according to several administration sources familiar with their discussions. Then on Sept. 9, Trump and Bolton spoke to try to clear the air. Either way, writes @bybrianbennett, Bolton's departure—announced the next day—represents a turning point for the Trump presidency. A blunt, famously effective bureaucratic knife fighter, Bolton had sometimes succeeded in steering Trump towards a tougher line in some parts of the world, including against Iran. Since joining the White House in April 2018, Bolton did away with much of the National Security Council deliberation processes and, in a break with his camera-shy predecessors, stepped into an outsized public role. He used his Twitter account to issue dire warnings in order to keep the #America’s adversaries off-balance. Now, with foreign-policy challenges simmering from the Middle East to the Korean peninsula to South America, the President’s national-security operation has lost one of its most powerful players. In this photograph from June, Bolton walks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.

When Robert Frank’s book The Americans was released, Practical Photography magazine dismissed the Swiss-born #photographer’s work as a collection of “meaningless blur, grain, muddy exposures, drunken horizons and general sloppiness.” The book’s 83 ­images were taken as Frank crisscrossed the U.S. on several road trips in the mid-1950s, and they captured a country on the cusp of change: rigidly segregated but with the civil rights movement stirring, rooted in family and rural tradition yet moving headlong into the anonymity of urban life. One of those pictures, Trolley—New Orleans, was named by TIME as one of the 100 most influential images of all time. Frank—who became a U.S. citizen in 1963—simply saw his adopted country as it was, not as it imagined itself to be. More than half a century later, that candor has made The Americans a monument of documentary and street #photography. Frank’s loose and subjective style liberated the form from the conventions of #photojournalism established by @life magazine, which he dismissed as “goddamned stories with a beginning and an end.” Frank, who died on Sept. 9 at age 94, was photographed in 2013 for a feature on prominent American artists who were in their 80s or about to arrive there.

But state legislators draw the lines, so control of Congress in many ways is decided by rules put together in state legislatures.” Democrats lost 958 state legislative seats during Obama’s presidency.

But overfishing has already caused the collapse of multiple wild-octopus fisheries around the world, and current populations likely face similar threats. Carlos Rosas, a biologist who aims to revolutionize how those gelatinous blobs wind up on dinner tables, believes inland aquaculture—raising the #animals from birth to adulthood in captivity—could be one way to meet increased demand without devastating the wild population, reports Tik Root. The approach has been tried with a variety of other marine animals, such as shrimp, salmon and tilapia, but octopuses have remained a stubbornly vexing puzzle. However, as the stability of wild populations has become more uncertain and the economic stakes have risen, teams in Spain, Japan and elsewhere around the world have also made significant progress on the surprisingly complex science behind octopus rearing. Critics find the prospect of cultivating such sentient animals for food barbaric. They point out that research shows the animals are highly intelligent, exhibiting complex behaviors incompatible with the enclosed environments of aquaculture. Rosas argues that it may actually be the best way to protect the species over the long term. And, hovering between a prototype and commercial scale, he’s at the forefront of the increasingly intense quest to build the world’s first octopus farm. Read more at the link in bio.

As the nascent Tea Party movement started stirring in the late 2000s, it was David Koch who saw the potential to use his family’s already formidable network of deep-pocketed allies to tap into the nation’s frustrations through groups like Americans for Prosperity. In doing so, he became perhaps the most prominent and vilified symbol of the billionaires who have turned 21st century politics into a playground of the privileged. His critics say he and his family’s network of donors and groups coarsened #politics during Barack Obama’s presidency to the point that Donald #Trump was able to win the Republican nomination in 2016, despite the fact both David and brother Charles both found Trump personally and politically abhorrent.

She works eight-hour shifts for $2.83 an hour; her tips are supposed to get her to $7.25 an hour, but they often don’t. “I have to make sure that my daughter has a roof over her head,” she says. Half a century ago, people like Munce without a college education could expect to make a middle-class wage. But in recent years, as male-dominated manufacturing jobs have been outsourced or automated, #women are contributing more to their families’ paychecks, and more of the 40% of Americans with no more than a high school #education are being pushed into the service sector—as waitresses, domestic workers, hairdressers and @uber drivers.

This is life in #America’s booming service industry. The decade-long economic expansion has been a boon to those at the top of the economic ladder. But it left millions of workers behind, particularly the 4.4 million who rely on tips to earn a living, fully two-thirds of them #women. Even as wages have crept up—if slowly—in other sectors of the economy, the minimum wage for waitresses and other tipped workers hasn’t budged since 1991. Indeed, there is an entirely separate federal minimum wage for those who live on tips. It varies by state from as low as $2.13 (the federal tipped minimum wage) in 17 states including #Texas, #Nebraska and #Virginia, up to $9.35 in #Hawaii. In 36 states, the tipped minimum wage is under $5 an hour. Legally, employers are supposed to make up the difference when tips don’t get servers to the minimum wage, but some #restaurants don’t track this closely and the law is rarely enforced. Waitresses are emblematic of the type of job expected to grow most in the #American economy in the next decade—low-wage service work with no guaranteed hours or income.

It was a historic moment, in no small part because of how casually he went about it: “Thought I made it obvious,” he tweeted, pointing out a rainbow on his album cover. He had some haters, but they were quickly and summarily dismissed—often by him personally. Meanwhile, “Old Town Road” continued to rack up millions of streams, extending its run atop the Billboard Hot 100. Now Lil Nas’ playful expression of his sexuality is just another part of his self-deprecating online brand. “Last year i was sleeping on my sisters floor, had no money, struggling to get plays on my music, suffering from daily headaches, now i’m gay,” he tweeted at the end of July.

Born in 1970, I grew up with a steady diet of fiction and poetry by writers who ‘looked like me.’ Dick and Jane were cast to the dustbin in favor of African folktales and the novels of Virginia Hamilton and Mildred Taylor. So, when I read ‘The Bluest Eye’ as a teenager and was gobsmacked by the sheer genius of the work, it wasn’t because I had never seen myself in a book. It was because I had never read a book this good.” Jones continues, “All of her novels center on the lives of people who struggle to find their place in a country that doesn’t always afford them true ownership on the land upon which they stand, the soil in which they find themselves rooted. They are treated like unwelcome but necessary tenants, that America requires in order to function.

The cathedral’s spire snapped off like a twig just before the sun set on April 15, crashing 314 ft. into the nave, through the ceiling that carpenters painstakingly carved by hand in the Middle Ages, using 5,000 oak trees. Within #France itself, the fire laid bare another, more complicated fragility: a tension rippling through the country, pitting the urge to preserve the past, and traditions of an exceedingly proud nation, against the need to overhaul its hidebound ways and modernize its system.

By the time Jordi Faulí joined the team as a junior architect in 1990, only three of the interior’s 56 columns (each one tied, in typical Gaudí fashion, to the liturgical calendar) and a handful of the windows had been completed. But that was before the miracle of modern tourism, writes @lisaabend. Although many in Barcelona would eventually see them as a curse, the travelers who began flooding the city at the start of the new century meant salvation for the #SagradaFamilia. As the number of visitors rose—the church currently gets roughly 4 million per year, and each one pays an entry fee that ranges from $16 to $43—the foundation overseeing the basilica found itself in the unfamiliar position of having enough money to finish the main nave. A soaring expanse with tree-like pillars and multicolored stained-glass windows that make it feel like a kaleidoscopic forest, the nave was consecrated by Pope Benedict in 2010.

In 2019, it seems President Trump would like to celebrate with a grandiose military #parade. And a lot of people are upset about it, writes Elliot Ackerman. They are upset because of the cost. Because of the spectacle. Because these critics anticipate—as is likely—that #Trump will politicize the event in an inappropriate, even tawdry way. He’s already expressed his intention to stand on that hallowed ground in front of the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have A Dream” speech, and deliver a speech of his own. Then flanked by all four of the service chiefs (who would surely rather be with their families at a backyard barbecue), he’s planned a massive military review, replete with supersonic fighter jets screeching past overhead and each service’s anthem blaring from the loudspeakers. Ackerman would bet about half the country loves the idea and about half the country hates it. Such a celebration is, like him, a polarizing prospect. And it is the perfect manifestation of our time.

Both gymnasts and USAG officials have revealed that under its previous leadership, it not only failed to immediately report sexual-abuse claims to law enforcement but also tried to keep those reports from becoming public. (In court, more than 150 women and girls, from local athletes to Olympic and world team members, said former national team doctor Larry Nassar sexually abused them over the past two decades; in 2018, Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison.) Some of them believe the only way forward is to raze the organization and create an entirely new body to represent #gymnastics.

Thanks to an influx of funding, some striking innovations and a lot of old-fashioned craftsmanship, the famously unfinished church is now on schedule to be completed in 2026, the 100th anniversary of the death of its architect, Antoni Gaudí. Today, more than two dozen architects are working on the project — most of them local Catalans — and 200 workers in total are involved in construction. But making the deadline will mean overcoming technical complications, theological doubts and several blocks’ worth of outraged residents. At a time when Barcelona is grappling with an unprecedented tourist influx that is challenging the idea of what the city should be, the plans for the church risk deepening social and political divisions.

The second night of the debates kicked off with some of the top contenders taking direct aim at President Donald Trump. Biden, Sanders, and Harris quickly moved to criticize the president and his 2017 tax cuts. “Donald Trump thinks Wall Street built America,” Biden said. “Ordinary middle class Americans built America.” Sanders faced a tough question on whether his proposals like Medicare for All would lead to higher taxes on the middle class. “Every proposal that I have brought forth is fully paid for,” he said, arguing that insurance premiums would be lower under his proposal. On the second of a two-night debate, the Democratic frontrunner will be up against some of his top opponents, including Sen. Harris and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

The exceptionally narrow margin in a city of 15 million people gave Erdogan cover to demand an election rerun. On June 23, Istanbul voted again, and Imamoglu won again–this time by about 800,000 votes. Erdogan has previously signaled an unwillingness to work with an opposition mayor, saying his party controls 25 of Istanbul’s 39 districts and a majority in the municipal assembly. Imamoglu will have to work with those officeholders to govern Istanbul, and he promised to do so Sunday.

He was wearing that black suit and tie at what’s thought to be the first U.S. picket for gay civil rights, which took place in #NewYorkCity in 1964. He wore it when he answered questions on-air in 1965 as one of the first openly gay men to appear on television. And he donned that suit again when he protested New York’s prohibition against serving gay patrons during a “sip-in” in 1966. Wicker jokes that he looked like a preacher for most of the 1960s—but for one of the earliest #LGBTQ activists, it was a political choice. It was also a choice that went hand-in-hand with the work Wicker did with the Mattachine Society, which he joined in 1958 when he was age 20. The Mattachine Society—considered one of the earliest gay #activist groups in U.S. history—had already existed for nearly a decade at that point, and its work in advocating for equal civil rights for gay people predated the Stonewall Uprising by nearly 20 years.

For decades the party existed largely underground, but it was ready and waiting when the uprisings known as the Arab Spring abruptly produced free elections. Mohamed Morsi was the Brotherhood’s candidate for Egyptian president, and its archetype: middle-class, professional (engineering degree from USC), with a neat beard and self-confidence verging on smugness. On June 17, 2012, Morsi—seen above in #Cairo in that all-important year—became the first democratically elected president in Arab #history. Seven years to the day later, Morsi died in a Cairo courtroom, at age 67. He had been imprisoned after only 13 months in office, a victim of Brotherhood insularity, mounting public distrust and an Egyptian security apparatus accustomed to being in charge. The coup was announced by General Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, whose forces slaughtered at least 800 Morsi supporters in the street. Al-Sisi now heads a government that international human-rights groups, noting Morsi was deprived of crucial medical care in prison, call responsible for his death, too.

The massacre killed hundreds, possibly thousands. The movement, favoring #democracy and reformist policies that caused rifts within the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, had spread to hundreds of cities before the government resolved to disperse it with brute force. Military tanks rolled into Beijing, where soldiers opened fire with assault rifles on the unarmed demonstrators who tried to stop their advance.

But in recent months, St. Pierre has been struggling. Why? Increased tariffs on goods from China imposed by the #Trump administration. That may seem counterintuitive. Tariffs on foreign goods are supposed to help companies that make things in the U.S. by increasing the costs of products sold by foreign competitors. Indeed, President Donald Trump has encouraged consumers and businesses to buy goods from countries other than #China, or, in what he called the “best idea,” to buy American-made goods. That advice is almost impossible to follow, writes our senior economics correspondent Alana Semuels, as products made in #America can contain parts sourced from all over the world. Even the most quintessentially American of goods has parts from somewhere else, whether that be a Ford F-150 pickup, a can of Budweiser, or tire chains from Worcester. Read more at the link in bio.

His latest work debuted at @sfmoma on May 23. JR, who collaborated with TIME for the 2018 project “Guns in America,” chose #SanFrancisco because it is a city struggling with contradictions—a home of staggering wealth and poverty, a hub of counter­culture and mainstream innovation, a tech-industry town where screens are supposed to connect people but instead cause isolation. “The concept of the mural is very simple,” he says. “No one is more important than another.” Among the individuals in his microcosm are millionaires and homeless people, protesters and police officers, drag queens and tech workers. He did audio interviews with subjects as well, asking people how they’d like to be remembered. Those stories will be presented alongside the kinetic version of the work, which is displayed on a canvas of interconnected screens measuring 107 ft. long (almost four cable cars) and 16 ft. tall.

When she was on the press tour for Thor: Ragnarok, plenty of journalists praised the character as a strong role model for little girls. She would always correct them: “Little girls, little boys, and little people who don’t know what they are yet.

Day—who was born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff in Cincinnati, and who died May 13 at age 97—was delightful in those pictures, a sunny, carbonated presence whose understated carnality was always just bubbling under the surface, writes TIME's film critic Stephanie Zacharek. She was never crude or over-the-top or even, really, suggestive; she was just sexy. The more you think about Day, it seems, the less you know. Everyone knows her megahit, “Que Sera, Sera,” a sort of anthem about going whichever way the wind takes you. Day has always been so charming as a presence that it has sometimes been easy to lose sight of what a phenomenal actor she was. In 'The Man Who Knew Too Much,' she plays a woman—a devoted mother and dutiful wife—cast squarely in what we think of as the ‘50s mold. But there’s no suburban complacency in her performance: She’s practically feral, so distraught over the loss of her son that she reverts to a state of wildness.

(30 kg.), his skin looking like it sticks to his bones, his muscles all but wasted away. #Venezuela remains far from famine, but food shortages are so persistent that the average resident lost 24 lbs. (nearly 11 kg.) in 2017, and malnutrition—a shortfall in calories and essential nutrients—is a growing concern, especially because it increases the risk of infectious disease. Those who struggled for health in normal times have been most vulnerable to the country’s dysfunction. Essential medicines are, like food, have been difficult to find or afford for years now. @unicef says 7 million Venezuelans, including 3.2 million children, are in need of assistance. “We are watching our people die,” says Carolina Leal, the community activist.

But by some measures, inequality in the country today is worse than it was under apartheid. In this photograph: Johannesburg suburbs Primrose (left) and Makause. Read more at the link in bio.

Buttigieg is a master of redefinition, a translator for a party that has found it increasingly difficult to speak to the voters who elected President Donald Trump, writes @charlottealter. The son of an English professor and a scholar of linguistics, he roots his campaign in an effort to reframe progressive ideas in conservative language. “If the substance of your ideas is progressive but there’s mistrust about them among conservatives, you have three choices,” Buttigieg tells TIME. “One is to just change your ideas and make them more conservative. The second is to sort of be sneaky and try to make it seem like your ideas are more conservative than they are. And the third, the approach that I favor, is to stick to your ideas, but explain why conservatives shouldn’t be afraid of them.” Read more at the link in bio.

Graham was talking about the actual temperature, but he just as easily could have been talking about the tensions: between Barr and the #Democrats, between Barr and Special Counsel Robert Mueller and between #Republicans and Democrats on the committee. For Democrats, the hearings were a chance to press Barr about his handling of the Mueller report, which a newly released letter showed the special counsel disagreed with. For Republicans, it was an opportunity to air their criticisms of the president’s investigators and call for the Russia investigation to be put to bed. The discrepancy between the two parties not only revealed the extent to which the Republican party will defend the commander in chief; it showed why Democratic leadership is treading so lightly on impeachment. To do it successfully and actually remove Donald #Trump from office, they would need at least 67 votes in the Senate.

They splintered into different denominations as founders established churches and set upon missions through the countryside and in neighboring Ghana, writes Kemi Alemoru (@kemstagramx). The distinct clothing style is inspired by a verse in the Bible (Revelation 19:8) that says fine, clean, white linen is “the righteousness of saints.” Beatrice Newman, a 30-year-old fashion designer who attends the Beneficial Veracious Christ Church on Peckham’s busy high street, Rye Lane, says the color code “shows unity” and is a way to “remember culture.” Read more, and see more pictures, at the link in bio.

In #London, the number of black Africans jumped by over 50% between 2001 and 2011, the time of the last national census. As more families settle from countries like Nigeria, they bring their faith and practices with them.

Like Brooklyn in New York, most came to the area for the lower rents—and stayed because of the burgeoning creative scene. The other side of Peckham lives on though, among its West African population. On a typical Sunday afternoon, Old Kent Road—a nearly two-mile stretch of chicken shops, cafés, barbers, and grocery stores—is crowded with worshippers from the Aladura Spiritualist churches dotted across the neighborhood.

What he called \"one of the top-10 best mornings of my life” turned into a “horrifically tragic afternoon,” as two students killed 13 people in one of the deadliest school shootings in American history. Leyba, 57, is one of 13 educators still teaching at Columbine 20 years later, working with students who weren’t even born when the shooting took place but who have grown up familiar with the routines of gun violence at a time when mass shootings occur with alarming frequency. Survivors are often called upon for their perspectives, even as many still struggle to make sense of what happened in 1999 and have no simple explanations for why it keeps occurring. “We’ve become the weird grandparents of school shootings, and when they happen, inevitably, people will reach out to us—sometimes it’s media, sometimes it’s communities—to try to understand why is this still happening,” Leyba says. “Why would we know?” In this photograph, Leyba poses for a portrait at a memorial site in Littleton, Colo., on April 18.

Notre-Dame began a $170 million (€150-million) construction project last year, in an effort to restore and upgrade the wooden roof and spire, which was considered to be the most urgently needed work. “It was a question of starting too late,” says Michel Picaud, head of the non-profit organization Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris, which launched a fundraising effort across the U.S. in 2017 to pay for the work. “There was fire proofing everywhere, but it was not enough, after what we saw,” he told TIME.

After all, the Augusta National Golf Club is where @tigerwoods, 22 years ago, first burst into our cultural consciousness, like no one we had ever seen before: golf’s first black superstar, a player who everyone figured would rewrite his sport’s record book. By the time he was 32, Woods had won 14 major championships during his astonishing prime. Then came the personal scandal about a decade ago, which the fed tabloids for months and destroyed his marriage. He returned to golf, but kept getting hurt. Woods fell out of the top 1,000 in the world golf rankings. He thought he may never play again. On Memorial Day Weekend in 2017, police found him asleep at the wheel, and arrested him. He had painkillers in his system, and was struggling with managing that pain. Wearing a Green Jacket less than two years later was unimaginable. The 14-year gap between Tiger’s fourth and fifth Masters wins is the largest in golf history. When he tapped in the winning putt, for his 15th career major, Woods screamed and flipped his club. Augusta’s proper “patrons” turned into actual sports fans, celebrating as if their team just won a Super Bowl. “Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!” the fans chanted, pushing up the volume to college football stadium decibel levels. Read the full story at the link in bio. Photograph by Kevin C.

Rooney, 28, mines similar territory in her latest love story, the equally engrossing but still more conventional Normal People. This book’s protagonists, Marianne and Connell, are in many ways opposites: she comes from a cold, wealthy family, he from one that’s cash-strapped but rich in love; she doesn’t care what others think of her, he does. But they share an anxiety about achieving “normalcy” that bonds them. Marianne also suffers from abuse at home, a fact she tentatively reveals to Connell. Rooney shines when she depicts how the waves of trauma consume both the victim and her romantic partners and offers a realistic portrayal of how two teenagers might struggle with the ramifications of one’s upbringing, writes @edockterman.

Europe’s far-right and nationalist parties tend to share little beyond concerns about illegal immigration and Islamist-inspired terrorism. But now Europe’s disrupters are trying to coax those big personalities to keep their eyes on a bigger prize: remaking the E.U. That was Bannon’s message when he opted to throw himself into the European campaign after leaving the White House. Inspired by Trump’s 2016 campaign, Italy’s Salvini–who has met with Bannon twice –has catapulted his anti-immigrant League party to the top of Italy’s polls with the slogan “Italy first!” In July, Bannon flew to London to meet right-wing Belgian politician Mischael Modrikamen. Over lunch, the two agreed to form an organization called the Movement, to bring together nationalist leaders across Europe ahead of the May 2019 elections. Bannon then darted around Europe, visiting right-wing leaders, as he attempted to knit together a coherent group. The idea, he told TIME, was to ready nationalist parties to win in the E.U. elections, through methods like data analytics and polling, honed during Trump’s campaign. “Europe is on fire right now with the populist movement,” he said last summer. “The centrist parties do not have the energy,” he said. “They do not have the youth, they do not have the ideas, they do not have the vigor.” Without a drastic fix, nationalism will increase its hold on the continent. “The status quo is not an option,” says France’s Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire. “The status quo will lead to the end of Europe.” Read more at link in bio.

Girls’ education was banned. Women were confined to the home and denied the right to work. These are living memories for millions of Afghans, and they have become present concerns as U.S. government representatives negotiate with the Taliban about a settlement that could see it return to a position of power and influence in Afghanistan. Today, nearly a third of the Afghan parliament and civil service are women. Afghan women are professors, artists, journalists, lawyers and judges; they serve in the national police force and military. The nation’s ambassador to the U.S. is a woman. This progress is inspiring yet fragile: women and girls there still routinely face discrimination and violence.

Over decades—first as a television executive, then as a wildlife filmmaker and recently as a kind of elder statesman for the planet—he has achieved near beatific status. He was knighted by the Queen in 1985 and is usually referred to as Sir David. In the autumn of his life, Attenborough has largely retreated from filmmaking on location but lends his storytelling abilities to wildlife documentaries in collaboration with filmmakers he has mentored. His most famous work, the 2006 BBC series Planet Earth, set a benchmark in the use of high-definition cameras and had a budget equal to that of a Hollywood movie. Now Attenborough, photographed at the Royal Botanic Gardens in #London, is putting his voice and the weight of authority he has accumulated to greater moral purpose. In recent months he has stood in front of powerful audiences at the 2018 U.N. climate talks in Katowice, Poland, and the 2019 World Economic Forum at #Davos, in Switzerland, to urge them into action on #climatechange. These kinds of events are not his chosen habitat, Attenborough tells TIME. “I would much prefer not to be a placard-carrying conservationist. My life is the natural world.

But when Carlos and Heyli arrived in #Texas and surrendered to Border Patrol, they faced a radical departure from what countless asylum seekers have experienced for decades.

But they assured him she would soon be returned to him. As Carlos let Heyli slip from his arms, she began to cry. “Don’t leave me here,” she said, reaching for her dad.

Plus, street violence hit too close to home a few years ago, when a cousin was murdered by suspected drug traffickers. Last year, the 25-year-old did what most Hondurans do when it’s time to get out: he approached one of the three local smugglers, who gave him a price: $7,000 to cross the Rio Grande and seek asylum—but only if he took his little girl and they surrendered to the U.S. Border Patrol on the other side. Otherwise it would cost $10,000 to traverse Mexico and then evade a gauntlet of law enforcement at the border and the interior checkpoints beyond.

Even on a winter day, with snow on the ground and only a few dozen #tourists at the popular Mather Point outlook, the jovial keeper of the canyon is in high demand. His celebrity may be local, writes Lily Rothman, but that spotlight has been shining a little more brightly lately, with the recent centennial celebration of the signing of the act that created #GrandCanyon National Park. Of course, the canyon itself is much older—to the tune of maybe 6 million years—so a hundred might sound small. But its place as a national institution is grounded in that moment, and what it looks like after the next 100 years is, in part, in the hands of people like Vandzura, who care for the land #America has decided is most worth caring for. A record 6.38 million people visited last year. “It’s well known that Americans love their national parks,” Vandzura says. Indeed, a record 6.38 million people visited last year. “We’re a culture that likes the idea of wide-open spaces.” But that appeal presents a challenge: how to keep natural beauty intact, and visitors in awe, even amid the crowds.

Nine days later, Hoover vanished from a frozen battlefield. The U.S. Army believed he had been killed in a surprise attack, but his commanders couldn’t say for certain. His body was never found.

But Beale Street‘s source material, while not “based on a true story,” gets at a different kind of truth. Some people who knew Baldwin believe the novel was likely inspired, at least in part, by the true story of one of the writer’s friends, William “Tony” Maynard, Jr. Maynard was falsely accused of murdering a decorated white Marine and spent more than six years behind bars. As soon as Maynard was released, his lawyer Lewis Steel began pushing Baldwin to write a non-fiction book about what Tony had gone through. It was tentatively planned under the title Upon My Soul, inspired by an exchange recounted in No Name in the Street, in which Maynard swore “Upon my soul, I didn’t do it,” and Baldwin responded “Upon my soul, we’ll get you out.” The book never happened, though an outline for it can be found within Baldwin’s papers. And though Maynard is still reluctant to open up completely, now he wants people to know what happened to him. “I think at that time I didn’t even want to tell [Baldwin] my story, and now I want to,” he tells TIME.

According to government data, winter crop production nationwide is forecast to decrease by 23% in 2018-19. On the country’s east coast, drought has affected 49% of its primarily grassy agricultural land and driven cattle slaughter up by 17%. In the supposedly temperate southeast, one-third of dairy farms are projected to lose money this year. The country has experienced 9 of the 10 warmest years on record since 2005, and a heat wave in January broke records across Australia.

But if Karl Lagerfeld, who died on Feb. 19 at 85, wasn’t always kind—he was well known for his wicked, sometimes cruel quips—he was so exquisitely distinctive, as a personality and as a designer, that ignoring him was impossible. The young #Lagerfeld began his career as an assistant to couturier Pierre Balmain, in 1955, eventually moving on to design for Jean Patou, @chloe and @fendi, where he served as creative director until his death. But the designer’s longest and most famous association is with the house of @chanelofficial, which he joined in 1983. Coco Chanel had revolutionized #fashion by introducing easy-fitting but impeccably constructed garments that freed #women from constriction, but by the 1970s, even her tastefully classic shapes had become stale. Lagerfeld swooped in like wind through an open window. His clothes were fresh and invigorating, season after season, even as they maintained proper respect for his forebear: he’d pair her trademark supple tweeds with biker jackets, or fashion her staid bouclé into swingy ponchos, fusing tradition with glamorous modernity. Lagerfeld’s signature look—stiff Victorian shirt collar, dark glasses, steel silver ponytail—was itself an extreme, dazzling work of invention. But where’s the line between self-caricature and irreproducible originality? Lagerfeld, photographed in Paris in 2009, walked it like a dancer. His steps can never be ­duplicated.

Congress wouldn’t shell out, either. So President Trump capped a two-month battle over his border wall by deciding to go it alone. “We’re going to be signing today, and registering, [a] national emergency,” #Trump said in a statement at the White House Rose Garden on Feb. 15. “And it’s a great thing to do, because we have an invasion of gangs, an invasion of drugs, and an invasion of people.” (Top government officials have disputed the President's characterization of threats at the border.) The unprecedented move allows Trump to signal to supporters that he’s still fighting to deliver the wall, while also sidestepping a second politically damaging shutdown. But the risky maneuver opens a Pandora’s box of future challenges, both in the courts and in Congress. And Republicans fear it raises the prospect of a future Democratic President wielding national emergencies as a tool to bypass Congress on liberal political priorities like climate change and gun restrictions.

One, Nicolás Maduro, secured a second term in a 2018 election widely regarded as a sham. The other, @jguaido, took an oath of office on Jan. 23, in a maneuver that was equal parts audacious and ingenious, and that offered the nation at least the possibility of a peaceful way out of its catastrophe. The trick was finding a possible opening in the mire of Maduro’s authoritarianism. By fiat and force, #Maduro has spent the last few years remaking the #Caracas government to his liking—replacing justices on the Supreme Court, declaring emergency rule, and sidelining the parliament that the opposition had won in a free and fair ballot in 2015. Maduro also created from whole cloth the electoral apparatus that allowed him to remain in office without facing an opponent—a violation of the country’s 1999 constitution. In response, the leader of parliament—Guaidó, photographed by @andrernandez on Feb. 5—said the presidential office had essentially been left vacant in January, the start of Maduro’s rigged second term. He then invoked the constitution’s Article 233, which, in a power vacuum, calls for the person in his role to temporarily assume the presidency. In the days that followed, most Latin American countries, the U.S. and much of Western Europe recognized #Guaidó as the legitimate leader of the most troubled country in the hemisphere, and mounted intense economic and diplomatic pressure on Maduro to step down. In Caracas, massive public demonstrations gathered to support the 35-year-old. By uniting a divided opposition, Guaidó appears to have given Venezuela its first real chance to restore democracy since its socialist experiment collapsed into economic chaos in 2014. “The difference now is there’s absolute hope,” he told TIME a week after the ceremony, his voice hoarse from days of campaigning. “Despair, disillusionment and frustration, have become energy, strength, a determination to fight.” Read more at the link in bio.

That was followed by an E. coli outbreak linked to locations in Washington State and Oregon, and then another norovirus incident in Boston. In total, about 500 people reported getting sick, and the string of food-safety issues sent the company’s stock plummeting from a high of more than $750 to under $400. Sales slumped by nearly one-third. Federal consumer-protection watchdogs launched an investigation. (The case is ongoing.) CEO Brian Niccol, who had been running @tacobell, took over in March 2018 to execute a turnaround. “The things that make us unique, we’re quadrupling down on that,” says Niccol, photographed while lunching near Chipotle’s new headquarters in Newport Beach. A new management team is also in the midst of experiments designed to lure consumers new and old, from a customer-loyalty program to beefed-up delivery options.

Speaking from the Rose Garden on Jan. 25, Trump retreated from his demand for $5.7 billion for a border wall to reopen the government, endorsing a three-week stopgap measure that would immediately end the shutdown without any additional border security funding. The retreat could have ripple effects far beyond the argument over a wall, setting a template for future face-offs on everything from executive privilege to health care, immigration and infrastructure. Trump used every tactic he knows: a last-minute veto threat, aggressive tweets, a prime-time address from the Oval Office, a visit to the border, walking out of a high-stakes negotiation, and it didn’t work. “We have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government,” he said. “After 36 days of spirited debate and dialogue, I have seen and heard from enough Democrats and Republicans that they are willing to put partisanship aside—I think—and put the security of the American people first.” In this photograph, Trump returns to the Oval Office after his remarks.

Inspiration came from his personal project “In the Russian East,” which was influenced by Richard #Avedon’s renowned series “In the American West.” Both photographers were inventive in how they framed their subjects—allowing the individuals or #families to literally carry over across the borders of the image. “The choice was appropriate to recall what America is built on: a large number of working migrants from all over the world,” Monteleone told @time. “This is equally true nowadays in Europe.” Monteleone and a small multimedia team traveled to #Tijuana in late November 2018, as a large #migrant caravan arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border. He taped a white vinyl backdrop on a wall outside a camp, and in between rain showers he interviewed and photographed dozens of migrants. “Eliminating the desperate conditions in which migrants are generally depicted allows the viewer to reflect on the story of the individual rather than the stereotypical ideas surrounding the migratory experience,” he said. Monteleone also traveled to Germany to photograph migrants who fled the civil war in Syria and to Murfreesboro, Tenn. There, he photographed Albertina and her daughter, Yaquelin, seen here, as they wait to hear if they will be granted #asylum in the U.S. Read @time's full special report, on why the forces of global migration can’t be stopped, at the link in bio.

In May 1964, less than a year after making his “I have a dream” speech, Martin Luther King Jr. (#MLK) delivered remarks at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that highlighted the need for justice and called for an end to segregation, as Senators in Washington, D.C., debated the Civil Rights Act. “Now is the time to make real the promises of #democracy,” King said. “Now is the time to open the floodgates of opportunity and allow now an avalanche of justice to pour upon us. Now is the time to get rid of #segregation and discrimination. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God’s children. This is the challenge of the hour.” Barbara Moss’s father, Jay A. Brown, worked as an assistant to Democratic Rep. Thomas Rees and attended the event, capturing it in color film. “What me and my mother can figure is that my father probably took his camera with him this day—he always had his camera—and by some miracle popped in color film into the camera,” Moss tells TIME. Describing him as a \"purger,\" she was surprised to find these pictures. “These are an American treasure, they shouldn’t be in a drawer,” she said. “If Martin Luther King were alive today, what would he be saying now?” she wondered. “His message was so important and resonates today clearly.” Read the full story, and see more pictures, at the link in bio.

Lazenko started working with anti-trafficking organizations in 2007, learning on the job how to minister to victims and campaign for awareness. In 2012 she was working for a support organization for sex-trafficking survivors in Florida when she started hearing strippers and sex workers talking about the money to be made in the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota and Montana. Figuring that wherever there was a demand for prostitutes, pimps and traffickers were sure to follow, Lazenko drove to #Williston on a reconnaissance mission. The situation, she says, was “worse than horrific.” Pimps had colonized the two local strip clubs and most of the hotels, but bartenders and front-desk managers had no idea what was going on. The only women’s shelter in town was for domestic-abuse victims, and it wasn’t equipped to deal with trafficking victims. Police investigators, Lazenko says, often ended up alienating and retraumatizing victims with insensitive questions about the number of johns they had slept with or why they never tried to get away. Today Lazenko spends most of her time on the road, traveling between conferences and conducting training sessions for cops and social-service organizations. She has testified before state lawmakers and served as an expert witness in sex-trafficking cases in Florida, Arizona, Montana and North Dakota. “We have to keep talking about sex trafficking,” she says, “otherwise it will stay a hidden epidemic.” Read @arynebaker’s full story at the link in bio.

Jane decides to keep the baby, a choice complicated by the fact that her longtime boyfriend is planning to propose. Meanwhile, the unintentional donor turns out to be an old crush. She navigates the love triangle with the help of her mother and grandmother, a trinity of kind, powerful and complicated women. To call the show a “guilty pleasure” would be to minimize its genius, writes TIME's Eliana Dockterman: the series proved that a warmhearted #heroine could be as complex and enthralling as the difficult men, like Mad Men’s Don Draper, who dominated prestige #television when Jane premiered. Behind the scenes as well, the show stood out from the rest of #Hollywood. Showrunner Jennie Urman has a team of 10 #women and three men for her writing staff. Four writers are Latinx, and women direct half the episodes. It was because of Urman that Gina Rodriguez (@hereisgina) fulfilled her own dream to direct, after others had rebuffed her: “People were just like, ‘You’re just a little Latina actress. How are you going to be a director?'” Though movements like Time’s Up (of which Rodriguez is an active member) are dedicated to addressing sexism and racism in Hollywood, #Latina women still account for a mere 7% of all speaking roles in major films. Just one Latina director, Patricia Riggen, helmed one of the 1,200 top-grossing #movies from 2007 to 2018, according to a recent study. Rodriguez says she is an activist first. On every project, she has demanded inclusion on a par with @cwjanethevirgin’s. “I refuse to enter a space where it’s not as liberating as this. Are 50% of the writers women? The directors? Are those women intersectional?” she says, referring to representation across race, class, sexual orientation and other aspects of a person’s identity. “No?

The deal was intended to smooth #Britain’s departure from the E.U. by setting out the terms of their post-split relationship. Unless an alternative plan can win the backing of Parliament, the country is on a default path to crash out of the bloc on March 29. That’s if Brexit isn’t delayed or canceled. In June 2016, 52% of British voters opted to leave the E.U.—but May warned in a last-ditch speech that if lawmakers rejected her deal, they would run “the risk of no Brexit at all.” That outcome is technically still possible, but unlikely. After all, on Jan. 16, May narrowly survived a vote of no confidence that could have toppled her government. In this photograph, May leaves the lectern after delivering remarks outside her 10 Downing St. residence in London, during which she said her door remains open to talks with Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.

The moment should have been celebratory—a rising star assuming her place among champions after defeating the greatest of them all. Instead, it was painful. “I didn’t want people to see me crying,” Osaka tells @time, “because that’s pathetic.” At first, Osaka thought the boos were for her. She knew the crowd, and millions more watching on TV, desperately wanted Williams to win a record-tying 24th Grand Slam title after she nearly died after giving birth. Osaka apologized for doing her job and beating her opponent. And so it was that the woman who could be the heir to the Williams sisters met the world through a frowning face and lowered brim. Three months later, she doesn’t fault Williams for fighting with the umpire and upstaging her victory. “Serena is Serena,” Osaka says in her first extended interview since the match. “I didn’t experience her life. I can’t tell her what she’s supposed to do, because there are things that she’s gone through. I have nothing against her or anything. I actually still really love her.” Osaka insists she’s come to terms with it all. She appreciates that Williams did eventually implore the crowd to stop jeering and applaud Osaka with a proper, if belated, ovation. In fact, Osaka insists she wouldn’t change anything about what happened. “In a perfect dream, things would be set exactly the way you would want them,” she says. “But I think it’s more interesting that in real life, things aren’t exactly the way you planned. And there are certain situations that you don’t expect, but they come to you, and I think those situations set up things for further ahead.” Read the full TIME International cover story on TIME.com.

Most of all, it is secluded—no staff, no uninvited visitors, no constituents. And it was in this hidden space in late September that the Republican from Maine weighed one of the most divisive decisions of her 21-year career in #Congress: whether to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative judge accused of sexual assault, to the Supreme Court. Collins faced an onslaught of pressure from the left to oppose the nomination. None of it daunted Collins, who has spent decades as a pivotal swing vote in the #Senate. Recalling the episode in November, Collins says she was “baffled” that #activists thought they could threaten her into voting their way. “I would never be intimidated by that,” she says. In the end, Collins cast one of the decisive votes for Kavanaugh, announcing her decision with a speech that shredded any illusions that she was unsure about her choice. Her vigorous defense of Kavanaugh, coming from one of the Senate’s last remaining moderates, showed just how polarized the chamber has become in the #Trump era. And it highlighted how difficult it is to be a centrist when everyone else has retreated to hyperpartisan corners. In this moment in American #politics, Collins can seem like the last of her kind.

A few hours later Aya received a telephone call from #Syria. “Go pack your bags,” her husband’s brother told her. “Mohammad is taking Joud to Syria, and he wants you to go with them.” If she wanted to be with her son, she would have to retrace the path she and her husband had taken more than three years ago, when they sought refuge in #Europe. Instead, Aya called the police. Her son, after all, had been born in #Germany. Her time in the country had taught her that she had rights. But it was too late. The police said her husband and son had taken a plane to Greece that morning. Her brother-in-law filled in the rest: as soon as they arrived, a smuggler took them across the border to Turkey, and they were now headed to Syria. A few days later, a series of text messages jolted Aya out of her grief. “If you want your son, you have to come back to us,” her husband wrote from his hometown of Idlib, where a unsteady truce held between the two sides in the #war. “You are becoming German. Come back to your culture, your religion and your people. Come be a good mother again.” In just a few messages, Mohammad laid out a central preoccupation for many Syrian refugees in Germany: how to embrace the freedoms of their new home while preserving the culture and traditions of the one they left behind.

He’d heard they could interfere with #­fertility—­steroids can shut down the body’s natural production of ­testosterone—but like many young #men, he was more concerned with not having #babies than with having them. Now he and his wife are trying to get pregnant, and though he gave up steroids two years ago, it seems the damage is done. When he got a semen analysis last March, his sperm count came back a flat zero. “It was earth-­shattering,” he says. Infertility is almost always thought of as a woman’s issue, and it’s true that #women bear the greater burden of it. They are the ones who ultimately either get #pregnant or don’t, and regardless of which partner has the fertility problem, the woman’s body is usually the site of treatment. In vitro fertilization, for instance, often requires just a sperm sample from men but a great deal more from their female partners: injections of synthetic hormones, blood tests, ultrasounds. And yet up to 50% of cases in which couples can’t have babies are due in some way to men. More men are talking about it now, but it remains stigmatized, especially in the U.S. Men are largely absent from public conversation around #infertility, and even those who have looked for #support hesitate to identify as someone struggling with male infertility. “I feel like I’m your stereotypical masculine-­looking man,” says Goldman. “I’m tattooed. I have muscles. I work out. And I’m infertile. How many other guys out there that have this machismo, this mind-set about them, are in my shoes as well?” Read TIME's full Special Report, The Future of Babies, on TIME.com.
