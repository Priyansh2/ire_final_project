Captained by yachtsman Boris Herrmann, the 60-foot (18-meter) Malizia II is fitted with solar panels and underwater turbines to generate zero-carbon electricity on board. \nAlthough little-known in the United States, Thunberg has arguably become the figurehead for a new generation of European eco-activists worried that they’ll suffer the fallout from their parents’ and grandparents’ unwillingness to take strong actions to combat #climate change. \nClick the link in our bio to read more.⁠\n#APPhoto by David Keyton @davidkeyton", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2eeff400e8ebc9c8d27987d25dbcf42d/5E5FBBD1/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66688320_329805414563532_9140325165434869999_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0fyZ92FrzP/", "caption": "A gunman cut through a fence to avoid security and opened fire at Northern California’s popular Gilroy Garlic Festival, killing three and wounding at least 15 before police fatally shot him as terrified people and performers ran for cover.\n\n#Gilroy Police Chief Scot Smithee said the gunman was armed with a rifle and sneaked in through a fence that borders a parking lot next to a creek.

Ten percent of those remain unidentified. \nThis photo shows the skull of an adult male, found in 2017 in Johannesburg, is laid out on a table inside the mortuary.

There wasn’t even any notice a visitor was coming. It was 2:30 on a weekday afternoon, and some women were roused from sleep by the sound of their cell door unlocking. They were asked if they’d pose for a portrait. \nThe setting was the Campbell County Jail, where the last time these female inmates looked into a camera, their mug shots were being taken. Some women were in for theft; others for drug possession or parole violations. For all, this stint behind bars was just the latest downward turn in a cycle of addiction and incarceration. \nMore than a decade ago, there were rarely more than 10 women in this rural Tennessee jail. Now the population is routinely around 60. The opioid crisis is putting more women behind bars across the U.S., tearing apart families and squeezing communities that lack treatment programs and permanent solutions. \nThe women say being locked up does little to prepare them for life on the outside, where friends - and in some cases, family - might lure them back into drugs again. \nPhotos by David Goldman @apdavidgoldman \n#opioids #portraits #film #CampbellCountyJail #prison #APPhoto #AssociatedPress", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d6c1c9d077a550bf53759796f5e051d3/5E54190F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/32121516_382143252288793_3234562659714072576_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bi9iyIvF_z8/", "caption": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pledged their lifelong love today as they married in front of hundreds of royals, celebrities and friends at St. George’s Chapel and millions of TV viewers around the world.

Increases are higher in several West Coast cities, where the explosion in homelessness has prompted at least 10 city and county governments to declare states of emergency since 2015.\n\nFor the full story, visit https://apnews.com/tag/HomelessCrisis\n\nPhotos by @jaechongpix\n\n#homeless #LosAngeles #California  #APPhoto #AssociatedPress #JaeCHong", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d07d05a539d4b658e72f65c0c646e2c9/5E624D9F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.0.1079.1079a/s640x640/25019025_1922311458028585_8829199527773732864_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BcXVDYxFQft/", "caption": "Lefteris Pitaraks, Associated Press Chief Photographer, Turkey, photographs athletes running over the \"July 15th Martyrs' Bridge\", formerly known as Bosporus Bridge during the Istanbul Marathon, which boasts the only course in the world involving two continents, Asia and Europe in one race, in Istanbul, Sunday, Nov. 12, 2017.

A Saadian dynasty monarch who ruled Morocco in the 1570s is believed to have imported the procession from the Ottoman Empire.\nThe parade has been held continuously since then. Men carrying wooden structures that resemble the minarets on mosques lead it off. Colorful candles arranged like mosaic tiles and spelling out the names of Allah, Muhammad, and members of the Moroccan royal family adorn the towers.\nChildren in traditional dress and musicians with horns and drums take part in the choreographed spectacle, which swells in size as people chase and merge with the festive throng moving through the old medina quarter. Families take to the streets and cheer from balconies.\nThe parade that takes place on the eve of the date recognized as Muhammad’s birthday — Dec. 1 this year — is the main event of a weeklong festival that gives local bands the chance to perform and receive tips from patrons. \nFor the full photo essay, visit AP Images Blog, link at profile. \n#Muhammad #birth #parade #celebration #boy #horse #Sale #Rabat #Morocco #MosaabElshamy #AssociatedPress", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/da742ebf75f2cf0baea2057420acee52/5E4CC645/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/24332275_170145610255670_1633764658424840192_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BcEHnQzhBb4/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/92c031b72908e28af71ba6b7b7ebd31e/5DC0D878/t51.2885-15/e15/24125650_191676101391339_2168790954985652224_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BcAeVSCFPAv/", "caption": "A Rohingya Muslim Naseer Ud Din, left, holds his infant son Abdul Masood, who drowned when the boat they were traveling in capsized just before reaching the shore, as his wife Hanida Begum cries upon reaching the Bay of Bengal shore in Shah Porir Dwip, Bangladesh, Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017. #APPhoto @daryasinap\n\nFor the past few days, we have been sharing a selection of photos and stories of the Rohingya exodus from AP South Asia News Director and AP photojournalist Bernat Armangué (@bernatarmangue) and AP photographer Dar Yasin (@daryasinap).

I’ve lost everything I owned.” He’s hoping that as a veteran he can get permanent housing, though he missed an earlier opportunity because a stint in a shelter disqualified him from being considered chronically homeless.\n\nHe gets by on $900 a month from Social Security and whatever he can scrounge up. A little extra cash might get him some crack to smoke at night. “I put needs first, drugs last,” he said.\n\nHe spent the remaining $105 from a recent check on a suit and put on makeup to look like Two-Face, the villain from Batman comics. He wanted to “make an honest living” with others dressed as superheroes or movie characters jostling for tips on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nBut it didn’t go well.

I got rid of whatever jewelry I had.” He never finished college studies in computer science, but managed to do computer work for years.\nHe and his wife lost a place to live when she accidentally set fire to her mother’s kitchen and the landlord wouldn’t let them return.\nPerkins said he’s been clean for six months, but it’s hard to remain sober on the street. He’s thinking of moving back to his native Cleveland and hoping to stay with his brother there. Perkins concedes that his drug problems have given his brother reservations, so he’s not sure that will happen.\n\nHe and his wife can’t afford a place to live in Seattle on the $760 disability check he gets each month from Social Security, and he’s resorted to begging.\nThe couple can’t stay together at a shelter and don’t want to be exposed to bed bugs and lice outbreaks there, so they opted to live on the street, where their possessions have been stolen.\n“Drugs are offered to me more than a place to live,” he said. “Even in my worst drug addiction days, I always kept a roof over my head. ... We literally have nothing. This is what we’ve got. It’s not worth it.” For more, visit APImagesBlog.com, link at profile.\n\nStory by Jae C.

I don’t let people mess with my family.”\nShe has known the cycle of dependence herself and been pulled down in it by partners, she said.\nSix times she’s lost a place to live because her third husband got high and got them evicted.\nThe final time came when things started looking up. Her husband had just landed a job, but spent his first paycheck on meth and got them booted again. She went her own way at that point.\n“I broke the cardinal rule. I met him at rehab,” she said. “One of the first things he said was, ‘Don’t fall in love with me. I’m not good.’ I should have listened.”\nShe didn’t get sober until her third try in rehab\nShe’s been homeless more than three years and has been talking with other campers about pooling money to rent a place, but it can cost $1,200 to $1,500 for tiny apartments.\nAt one point, she and a daughter were living in someone’s storage room for $700 a month. It was hard to afford on her monthly $734 disability payment.\n“Most homeless people I know aren’t homeless because they’re addicts,” she said. “Maybe they were at one time. Most people are homeless because they can’t afford a place to live.” Story by Jae C.

His beard and hair are starting to gray and a cigarette is propped behind his left ear.\n\nHe had a job, but “it just got away,” he said. He figured he’d find another, but it never came along. “I’m not fighting, like I used to,” he said. “When I was younger, before I got a job, I used to fight a lot.” Now he is trying to beat drugs and alcohol.\n\nWilliams would like a place to live and some money, but said he doesn’t stay at shelters and hasn’t signed up for any public assistance. For now, he’s mostly comfortable where he is. “I’m not bothering nobody,” Williams said. “I’m not being bothered.” #APPhoto @jaechongpix \nFor more, visit APImagesBlog.com, link at profile \nStory by Jae C.

Below, Foley recalls events surrounding the picture. “I noted what looked like a pile of rubbish at one spot in the street; but as I got closer, I saw that it was a pile of dead bodies. Then I looked in a house window and saw a family that had been shot as they ate dinner. Down the street was the corpse of a dead horse, its throat slit.” While he was making pictures, Foley learned from survivors that the militia hired by the Israelis to manage the Palestinian camps had turned its wrath over the Bashir Gemayel assassination on the camp members and had slaughtered some eight hundred of them, mostly women and children.\n\nThe sound of oncoming vehicles alerted Foley to the fact that Israeli forces were coming to the camp, so he and his taxi driver departed. Using a circuitous route through Beirut, they made their way to an Israeli press camp at Baabda, in the Israeli-controlled sector of Lebanon just outside Beirut. Foley placed a call to AP in New York and dictated details of the story. He was about to transmit his photos on the same phone circuit when the power was cut.\n\nFoley had heard that NBC television had arranged a charter aircraft to carry television footage to Tel Aviv; and as he and the taxi driver headed for the airport, he hid his prints and film in the back of his shirt, just in case they were stopped. They made the plane, put the film and prints in the pouch, and AP staff in Tel Aviv transmitted the pictures to the world.\n\nInternational reaction to Foley’s pictures and their mute testimony to the massacre at Sabra Camp was vigorous. In 1983, an Israeli investigation found that Israel’s Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon, bore indirect responsibility for the incident.\n\n#APPhoto #blackandwhite #BWphotography #photojournalism #APArchivePhoto #TheAssociatedPress #pulitzerprize @pulitzerprizes", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/130407de2d3067ee2c16b9f21b3a0495/5E52F128/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c195.0.690.690a/s640x640/22069743_1976180592630504_6270215960792137728_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BZjHbqpBkvx/", "caption": "A powerful explosion is seen in the ammunition depot at a military base in Kalynivka, west of Kiev, Ukraine, Sept. 27, 2017. #APPhoto Efrem Lukatsky\n\n#explosion #flames #fire #militarybase #Kalynivka #Ukraine", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/170790e8ae2d5fe786ee5a8bb547a4e9/5E529B09/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c184.0.712.712a/s640x640/21985427_1310432305732243_2006708127709265920_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BZhAEkuBXEo/", "caption": "A Balinese man watches Mount Agung volcano almost covered with clouds as he stands at a temple in Karangasem, Bali, Indonesia, Sept. 26, 2017.  #APPhoto @firdialisnawati \n#MountAgung #volcano #clouds #temple #Bali", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e1413fcebf1624faca5c87ee5ace045a/5E4273FB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/22071349_170584860159406_2010594149694177280_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BZes59phTts/", "caption": "Sixty years ago today, the Little Rock Nine became a symbol of heroism in the throes of racial progress.

But thanks to the careful eye of a veteran Associated Press photographer David J. Phillip (@djp_b_and_h) assigned to cover the storm, the world already knows the mother, child and officer as the faces of the struggle to deal with the devastation. “I was just keeping an eye out and as soon as I saw the SWAT team member carrying her and then seeing the baby, I just couldn’t believe that baby was wrapped up in there and not crying,” Phillip said of the moment Sunday afternoon when his lens found the trio. “It was just tender. It was very special.” Phillip’s photo shows officer Daryl Hudeck, in baseball cap and fatigues, carrying Catherine Pham and the son she cradled through knee-deep water covering Interstate 610, in southwest Houston.\n\nPhillip said the woman and child were rescued along with the baby’s father from their home in the city’s Meyerland section, where water reached many roofs.\n\nSoon after the Phams were rescued, Phillip said, he broke away to transmit the photos. It’s a good thing, too. Not long after, a boat he was on hit an object underwater, probably a submerged car, and the photographer was pitched backward into the water. His leg was scraped by the boat’s outboard motor before fire department rescuers could pull him on board. One of his cameras and all the images it contained were lost. \nPhillip, who is 51 and has been a photographer for the AP for 22 years, all based in Houston, has covered many hurricanes.

Icebergs aren't sea ice, despite being best known for floating about the ocean. They are actually chunks of glaciers that have broken off at the water's edge. About 90 percent of an iceberg is under the surface of the water. Since glaciers are made from freshwater and compacted over dozens if not hundreds of years, icebergs are naturally among the hardest types of ice a ship might encounter.\n\nFor more, visit apimagesblog.com, link at our profile. \n#iceberg #drop #melting #NuupKangerluaFjord #NewArctic #Greenland #DavidGoldman #TheAssociatedPress", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b51a96f866e9fa0361cad04d5a058a19/5E538839/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c168.0.743.743a/s640x640/20987587_507350882941395_3047448346424770560_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BYEVyeMhb3N/", "caption": "President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron watch the solar eclipse, Monday, Aug. 21, 2017, at the White House in Washington. #APPhoto @andyharnik  #SolarEclipse2017 #DonaldTrump #MelaniaTrump #solareclipse #AndrewHarnik #TheAssociatedPress", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2911e021536c3766f593936952b5d9cd/5E48814A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/20905244_1857960657552401_1268755398190432256_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BYEJCaAh9Ag/", "caption": "The moon covers the sun during a total eclipse Monday, Aug. 21, 2017, near Redmond, Ore. #APPhoto @tedswarren\n\n#eclipse #SolarEclipse2017 #totaleclipse #TheAssociatedPress #AP #moon", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c5e548d112ed0a3e79081243743c6274/5E40C99B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/20968884_686836671513513_7019558982234669056_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BYChWrPBQK1/", "caption": "Protesters attend a rally to support young activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow in downtown Hong Kong Sunday, Aug. 20, 2017.

On the day of the parade, we arrived at the scene a couple of hours early. I had no idea Kim Jong-en was going to be there until my minder, with some prompting and persuasion, reluctantly confirmed that the young Kim would accompany his father, Kim Jong-il to the event. Before this, the only impression the world had of Kim was from a black and white photograph of him at 7-years-old. I realized immediately that the image of the two Kims together would be much more important than the parade itself.\n\nFrom a visual point of view, it is usually not desirable to have two people standing so far away from each other. However, because father Kim was glancing at his son, the space between them became meaningful by creating an impression of the relationship between the two men.\" Vincent Yu's exhibition 'Nine Lives' opens today, Friday, Feb. 17 at Anita Chan Lai-ling Gallery - Fringe Club in Hong Kong and closes on Feb. 28.

Over the next four days, I’ll be sharing a collection of portraits I made with a phone camera of soldiers I met on checkpoints and front lines around Mosul, a mix of young and old, police and soldiers, and a variety of irregular uniforms and equipment.\n\nI took phone photos on this assignment in places where bigger, louder DSLR cameras were initially unwelcome. People tend to be more relaxed when approached with a request to be photographed with a phone camera, and their calmness added to the atmosphere of the images. Although using a phone camera is a compromise against image quality, the laid back attitude and the sense of pride soldiers manifested while posing for a quick happy snappy worked well when juxtaposed against the often stark surroundings they found themselves in. Using a phone to take photos also made for a good ice breaker. The initial tension would quickly dissolve, and my presence in awkward places would be accepted to a higher degree by the military units I was following. \nThe third portrait in this series was made at a checkpoint in Gwer, 30 kilometers southeast of Mosul, Iraq, in an area controlled by Kurdish forces. At one point, the soldier in the photo, Hiwa Omar, appeared with parts of his AK47 rifle covered in colors of the Kurdish flag, and I felt compelled to ask him to pose for a portrait. The caption reads: In this photo taken Monday, Oct. 24, 2016, Hiwa Omar, 25, from Irbil, Iraq, a Kurdish Peshmerga soldier, poses for a portrait while guarding a checkpoint in Gwer, some 30 kilometers southeast of Mosul, Iraq. #APPhoto by Marko Drobnjakovic\nTo see the entire collection, please visit the AP Images Spotlight blog, apimagesblog.com, or go to apimages.com.\n\n#InstagramTakeover #AP #AssociatedPress #APImages #Mosul #Iraq", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/add76c738a0104ebbc1f112841b19ca1/5E527502/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/15043660_202677046849779_2324893740382027776_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BNFQTVpgX0E/", "caption": "Good day @ap.images followers!

Soni described as marines blindfolded him, bound him and took him with four relatives and friends to a dimly lit, windowless warehouse and was tortured. Soni says he suffered beatings, electric shocks, asphyxiation, and sexual abuse. He heard his teenage nephew scream as they applied electric shocks to the boy's ribs. #APPhoto by @apmarcougarte \nEven today, there has been no justice for Soni and the others. They were held on weapons and drug charges. They spent more than a year in prison without trial until a judge in March 2015 threw out the case.\n\nFrom the day of their arrest through the day their release was signed, the men never once saw the judge. Soni hopes that this will change under Mexico's new justice system, where both sides will have to present arguments and evidence in open court. His case is now being handled by a special unit created a year ago to investigate torture.\n\n#Mexico #MexicanMarines #torture #HumanRights #AssociatedPress #APImages #photojournalism", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d4f86f1269d088d05f553ee292aa0732/5E5B51B3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/14606947_223456271418200_2897391384627511296_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BM41qSHgOA2/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/66b205cf6b4d4ce8f068fc35c1c5bf14/5DC06477/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/15035003_1155003431254155_6968973694941003776_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BMzv2k8A7Yw/", "caption": "The moon rises behind the castle of Almodovar in Cordoba, southern Spain, Nov. 13, 2016.

Even so, with just under 60,000 migrants arriving in the Netherlands last year, they have been temporarily pressed into service to house hundreds of asylum seekers.\n\nSee the full photo essay at blog.apimages.com \n#IjaawaMohamed #refugees #migrants #prison #chair #DeKoepel #MuhammedMuheisen #Haarlem #Netherlands #AP #AssociatedPress #APImages #photography #photojournalism", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/340c379347e578ed9f50755121a17d02/5E4DE437/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/13167327_1037933439620729_436165141_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BFhJUw0xRau/", "caption": "A girl from the community who call themselves the \"Muhammasheen,\" or \"the Marginalized,\" peers through a curtain of her hut, in a slum area of Sanaa, Yemen.

More than two weeks after the explosion, oil had yet to wash ashore, and images of huge ships floating amid a slick above the broken well had grown commonplace. #APPhoto by Eric Gay\n\nSan Antonio-based shooter Eric Gay was sent on a mission to capture the scale of the slow-motion catastrophe. \"I had been on helicopter several times trying to show the oil coming to the coast, because we knew it was going to hit at some time,\" he said. One day, he found it: a massive area of orange swirls against a floating field of black. \"I expected to see a big black blob floating out there,\" he said, \"but then it was this orange, swirling thing that looked like something from another planet.\" Several miles out from land, and with no ships nearby, the image was abstract.

He mostly does administrative stuff, managing photographers and editors over a breadth of 30 countries, but every now and then he shoots too. It's true that he is a genius, and I'm not just saying that because he's my boss.\n\nThis scene of residents waiting for the popemobile to ride past is a gem of a photo.

Alessandra's based in Rome and has temporarily joined our Cuba photo team to cover the pope, at least her sixth trip with two pontiffs around the globe.\n\nAs I edited her coverage this morning, I asked her if she was cool with my crop of one of her images. It was the second time I'd proposed a crop and asked to see an image without her crop. After seeing it, she answered: \"Nice! You can crop everything you want! It's an honor to be cropped by you!\" It's nice to be trusted with someone else's work, but since it's the photographer's byline published with the photo, not mine, I believe it's only right for them to sign-off on it. For me it's also important to chip away at the \"us vs. them\" mentality of photographers and editors, and be the kind of editor I'd like to work with.\n\nThe photo in question was a flag waving shot, but I prefer to share this daily life scene by Alessandra of a market vendor prepping onions hours before Pope Francis landed on Saturday. It's as if the man is stepping out of the shadows, symbolic of Cuba reemerging as Havana and Washington reestablish relations. US tourists can finally visit this hidden treasure just miles off their own coast.

First, I'm a sucker for female religious icons. I suspect it has to do with my doll collecting hobby and my appreciation for the many incarnations of the Virgin Mary as Christianity's modern day Mother Earth. And get a load of those finger nails! Perfectly color-coordinated with the Virgin of Charity's purple and gold robe. \nShe's the island's patron saint, the protector of sailors and copper miners. She's also the sister goddess to \"Ochun,\" the Afro-Cuban goddess of rivers, maternity and love. Long live the sisterhood! \nCaption - Yelenis Teruel Salas shows her key chain of the Virgin of Charity outside the San Isidoro Cathedral where she prayed as part of her 15th birthday celebration, or \"quinceañera\" in Holguin, Cuba, Saturday, Sept. 19, 2015, on the day Pope Francis arrived to island.

The woman at right in a white jumpsuit is pregnant, symbolizing life, on the throne made for the woman at center who's going through a series of rituals to become a Yoruba priestess. Her mother sits at left, representing a woman who's already given life. \nHer dress and crown are the very same color worn by Cuba's patron saint, Our Lady of Charity. In fact, one of her initiation rites includes praying to this Christian icon. It's fascinating how spirituality in Cuba is expressed in many ways, where a variety of beliefs are accepted and mixed together in a country that for decades was officially an atheist state. \nCaption: In this photo taken on Sept. 11, one week before the pope's arrival, Marisa Ramirez Gutierrez, standing center, holds still on her throne dressed in the robe of the \"Iyawo,\" or bride, at her home in Havana, Cuba. Gutierrez's other initiation rituals include a dip in a river, sitting for an entire day with the pregnant woman, a celebratory dinner party with family and friends, and leaving herbal offerings at a local market.

While this version of the Virgin Mary is recognized by the Catholic Church, she is also adored by practitioners of Cuban Santeria, who associate her with the Yoruba deity Ochun, goddess of sweet water and gold. Pope Francis will be the third pontiff to make the trek to far-eastern Cuba to visit the religious icon. Unlike Pope John Paul II, Francis will visit the sanctuary in the foothills of the Sierra Maestra. During the historic 1998 papal visit the 16-inch figure was taken from its santuary and taken to Santiago de Cuba for a coronation ceremony, where John Paul placed a crown on the doll-sized statue, and then put an even smaller crown on the infant Jesus she bears in her arms.\n\nIn this March 25, 2012 file photo, a woman irons a cassock to be used by a priest who will accompany Pope Benedict in the celebration of Mass at the cathedral in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba.

A frail-looking Pope John Paul II was met on the tarmac by Fidel Castro, the leader of a communist government that had once banned Catholic schools and sent priests, including the current archbishop of Havana to prison or work camps.\nAnd well, I missed it. It barely registers for me as I was busy nursing my newborn baby daughter in Nicaragua. I had given birth just nine days earlier. She's 17 now and makes her own lunches.\n\nThis time I will be fully tuned-in when Pope Francis arrives in Havana where he'll find a more influential church since John Paul's prophetic words during that historic visit, \"May Cuba, with all its magnificent potential, open itself up to the world, and may the world open itself up to Cuba.\" The serious work begins this Sunday starting at 7am, with all hands on deck. Just to give you an idea of how serious, on Sundays the LatAm photo desk in Mexico City usually opens at midday, and only for eight hours, with one photo editor. So you could say we are tripling our efforts.\n\nWe are expecting a whole lot of images. You will be seeing some of our favorites in this #takeover Stay tuned.\n\nIn this Jan. 21,1998 file photo, Cuba's President Fidel Castro, and Pope John Paul II check the time during a welcoming ceremony in Havana, Cuba.

Wait. What?! Wait. Oh no. Oh yes. We were stunned as we stood before the TV as the news was announced right in the middle of AP regional headquarters in Mexico City. Like many, we were interested in knowing who the new pope would be, not so much expecting to spend the next few weeks reporting on this man who some referred to as the \"slum bishop.\" Albeit a contender, Bergoglio was a longshot. I think his odds were like 25-1. Truth be told, we had very little on the Argentine cardinal who would be pope.\n\nBefore March 13, 2013, a search for \"Jorge Bergoglio\" in the massive vault of AP Images would have brought up 20 hits, at best. Today plug in \"Jorge Bergoglio\" and the search will bring up over 600 hits. But nothing compares to the more than 21,000 hits for \"Pope Francis,\" the last I looked. More now to be sure. \nHey, how did I get inside my computer. ^_^ I uploaded a photo of me, made by @lesliemazoch and turned it into a screen saver, and then photographed my desk using my #iPhone. Leslie is the desk supervisor and you will be seeing her takeover posts on Sunday.\n\n#photojournalism #fotoperiodismo #office #desk #Mexico #torredeangel #gatekeeper #headquarters #religion #papa #pope #popeFrancis #papaFrancisco #Catholic #papacuba #walkwithFrancis #habemuspapam #cuba #havana #PopeinCuba #popevisit2015 #papalvisit2015 #faithful #catholicchurch #pontifex #lahabana #saturday #instagram", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/30b0b6956ab695bc2ef319bd6829cbb5/5E5EDD34/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/11821292_894702493949294_370119169_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/7etAbJxRfa/", "caption": "Hello everyone, this is Gregorio Borgia (@gregorioborgia), Associated Press photojournalist based in Rome.

This is my last post, thank you all for your likes and comments! Stay tuned for more takeovers from AP photogs based around the world!\n\nIn this picture, Serenity Palomera, 3, laughs as she shares a bath with her cousin in ankle-deep water at their home in Okieville. At play in the water, the girls often drag out their bath time, opting to slosh around for a long as possible before bedtime. Washing two kids at the same time saves water for the family since their well dried, but for Serenity, it's just more fun.\n\nWater use seems to come  to base priorities for Tulare County. This from our story by AP staff writer Scott Smith gives you an idea of the struggle playing out: \"Farming in Tulare County brought in $8.1 billion in 2014, more than any other county in the nation, according to its agricultural commissioner. Yet 1,252 of its household wells today are dry — more than all other California counties combined.\" Look for more images from my photo essay at www.apimages.com or at http://bit.ly/1UgSEqk or here @ap.images during this week. \n#InstagramTakeover #takeover #APOnAssignment #AP #AssociatedPress #photoessay #documentary #photojournalism #drought #caldrought #centralvalley #sequía #california #gregorybull #photooftheday #igers #igersofcalifornia #ig_americas #ig_northamerica #igtakeover @instagram #apimages #trabajodecampo", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4e95aa7cb445b5308136c0f9fefb4ba3/5E451112/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c180.0.719.719a/s640x640/11849790_870036133049868_1085572392_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/7LIE8RxRTd/", "caption": "Hola todos this is AP staff photog @gregorybull, posting an Instagram takeover this week from my photo essay on California's drought and its effects on a tiny Central Valley community known as Okieville. \nIn this image, Elias Trejo squirts himself with a water balloon while running around in his yard with his sister.  Despite pleas from his family to stop wasting water, Elias couldn't resist, as temperatures in dusty Okieville hovered in the high nineties. The family had stopped using water for irrigating any kind of lawn or ground cover. Two large planters flanking their front door sat empty. Only an occasional trickle went to keep the few trees alive. So when Elias decided to sneak a little water for a water balloon fight with his sister, it was hard to blame him. \nThe strange thing about the Central Valley is, despite all the dry wells and talk of drought, you actually see water all over the place. Water gushes out of irrigation pipes on the large farms that circle Okieville. It sits in rows of corn that stand at least eight feet tall. And it comes from the same place, underground, pumped up by wells. Just deeper. Deep wells are expensive to drill, and most of the families of field workers can't come up with the thousands of dollars it takes to drill down to where water still exists. So their shallow wells run dry.\n\nLook for more images from my photo essay at www.apimages.com or at http://bit.ly/1UgSEqk or here @ap.images during this week. \n#InstagramTakeover #takeover #APOnAssignment #AP #AssociatedPress #photoessay #documentary #photojournalism #drought #caldrought #centralvalley #sequía #california #gregorybull #photooftheday #igers #igersofcalifornia #ig_americas #ig_northamerica #igtakeover @instagram #apimages #trabajodecampo", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5f45a5f94071f025cf1a8fa7c6a1ed12/5E646245/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c180.0.719.719a/s640x640/11261342_814144495371969_1234042429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/7JNNI4xRcV/", "caption": "Hola todos this is AP staff photog @gregorybull, posting an Instagram takeover this week from my photo essay on California's drought.

Four generations of Dunlaps share the house, and their family is one of the few remaining from the Okieville camp set up in the 1940s. Little has changed in all those years, until the family's 170-foot well ran dry in February.

As Yaritza's family began to run out of available water in 2014, she began to pray for it during her nightly prayer. “God, give us water so we don’t have to move,” the 4-year-old says, pressing her palms together. \nBefore San Diego, I was based in Latin America for many years. I've photographed many scenes of prayer, but never prayer for water. Yaritza, so little, can already pick up on the deep concerns of the family. But she is in good hands with her grandmother, Maria. You can feel Maria's tenacity, strength, in that house, as if somehow things are going to be okay in the end. \nIn this essay, and in the story by staff writer Scott Smith, we really wanted to feel what it was like for the people in the epicenter of California's drought. Pictures showing land erosion on hillsides and crops can be powerful too, but this time we wanted to let drought's victims speak. \nLook for more images from my photo essay at apimages.com or at http://bit.ly/1UgSEqk or here @ap.images during this week. \n#InstagramTakeover #takeover #APOnAssignment #AP #AssociatedPress #photoessay #documentary #photojournalism #drought #caldrought #centralvalley #sequía #california #gregorybull #photooftheday #igers #igersofcalifornia #ig_americas #ig_northamerica #igtakeover @instagram #apimages #trabajodecampo", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4644fd324468385bed7a4e752562b005/5E47DCB9/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c169.0.742.742a/s640x640/11820489_140547112954837_95287028_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/7GTHhpRRVE/", "caption": "This is AP staff photog @gregorybull, posting an #instagram #takeover of a tiny, drought-stricken community called Okieville, in California’s Central Valley. \nIn this picture, Tree Dunlap holds an image of her Oklahoma ancestors as she stands near the house she shares with four generations of her family. The Dunlaps have lived in Okieville since it was an Okieville - the name given to the camps of people who fled the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. Chased out of Oklahoma by drought, they have landed in another. The Dunlaps are one of the last remaining families from the Dust Bowl era in Okieville, and I got the sense they weren't planning on going anywhere anytime soon. To me, the Dunlaps seemed to be most about tradition, family.
