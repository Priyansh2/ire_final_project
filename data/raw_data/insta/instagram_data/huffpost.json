Friedman cited California as “a world leader in animal welfare,” adding, “we will not continue to be complicit in unnecessary cruelty towards animals solely for the sake of fur.” // Read more in the link in bio. // 📷: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9915e8a0b6baeb908d65d4629e23961e/5E3FF1A2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/72249593_476850452908548_275693260304536897_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3o6qSnnAYk/", "caption": "So excited!! 😱 “Pose” star Billy Porter confirmed that he’s signed on to play the fairy godmother in Sony’s “Cinderella.” The forthcoming adaptation of the classic fairy tale will star Camila Cabello as the titular heroine, and Idina Menzel is reportedly in talks to play the wicked stepmother.

I think that those same basic principles do apply to mental health, but that hasn’t become infused into our society yet.” This full understanding requires effort: It also takes good parenting, especially since research shows mental health issues can appear in people as young as toddlers or preschoolers. It depends on proper health care and better access to treatment, particularly in rural areas of the U.S. It means correcting ― or even just noticing ― if people use mental health-based language in a derogatory way.

In 1977, Big Bird and cast member Buffy Sainte-Marie taught young “Sesame Street” viewers about breastfeeding. In a one-minute scene, Sainte-Marie breastfed her son Cody and answered Big Bird’s questions about nursing.”Lots of mothers feed their babies this way,” she said. “Not all mothers, but lots of mothers do.” In 1988, the show featured a similar scene with Sonia Marzano aka Maria. These scenes are short and simple, which speaks to the reality that ― despite what countless incidents of shame and harassment suggest ― breastfeeding is a completely normal and natural act. Perhaps more children’s programs will take note and consider implementing these kinds of brief but educational moments in shows today.

The 27-year-old Muslim woman had not been to the beach in years, despite living in a state with over 40 beaches. Ever since she started wearing a hijab as a teenager, she never went swimming. Until now. Dressed in the new burkini she bought earlier this year — black leggings, a bright pink long-sleeved swim tunic, topped with a built-in black hijab — Hussein pushed away her fears and looked ahead, ready for the muscle memory to kick in. She tried not to pay attention to fellow swimmers nearby. She tried not to worry that someone might harass her, or even worse, physically attack her. It wouldn’t be the first time it happened. Muslim women like Hussein have long been persecuted and intimidated for wearing a modest bathing suit. They have been kicked out of pools and beaches. They have been told that their bathing wear wasn’t suitable. Pool- and beachgoers have even told them to go back to their country. Some have called the police on them. Swimming is one of America’s greatest pastimes, but due to their visibility, Muslim women who wear a burkini face a huge risk of harassment. HuffPost spoke to over 30 Muslim women across the country who described a wide range of experiences swimming in America. Not all of their encounters were negative, but the vast majority of interviews uncovered a pattern: Muslim women are still fighting for their right to swim. Often they are confronted in public, humiliated and abused. They face decades of entrenched prejudice from people who view their modesty as oppressive and unfeminist. // Read more at the link in bio. // 📸: @kholoodeid", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f87957134a8712c1dd96b3cbb637d6de/5E463606/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.123.1052.1052a/s640x640/67944120_131337564816964_2603571689570409342_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B14vxh8jtCv/", "caption": "For the best sleep of your life, tell your partner to hightail it to the couch and cuddle up to Fido instead. A recent study by researchers at Canisius College in Buffalo, New York, suggests that women tend to sleep better next to dogs than they do next to members of their own species. (Or pet cats. Sorry, cat people.) Led by associate professor Christy L. Hoffman ― a self-professed dog person (sure, go ahead, call out her blatant canine bias) ― the researchers surveyed 962 women living across the United States. Of this sample, 55 percent reported sharing their bed with at least one dog and 31 percent with at least one cat. Of those women, 57 percent also slept with a partner. The participants filled out a questionnaire about their quality of sleep and how safe they felt as a result of their dog or cat’s presence. Those with partners were asked how the other person affected their sleep and their feelings of security at night. After analyzing the data, Hoffman and her team found that human partners and cats were equally disruptive to a woman’s sleep, whereas dogs were less likely to wake their owners up. Why’s that? Hoffman told HuffPost it might be because dog owners tend to have better sleep habits and stricter daily routines than than people who don’t have dogs: On the whole, dog owners had earlier bedtimes and wake-up times than women with cats.⁠\n“Dog owners have to adjust to their dogs’ needs to toilet each morning, and this helps keep dog owners on a relatively strict wake-up routine,” she said. “And dogs’ major sleep periods tend to coincide more closely with humans’ than do cats.” Plus, Hoffman said, dogs as bed partners may adapt a bit more to their owners’ schedules than human partners do.

It’s a decision she told the paper she made at the time because she was going through a period of personal turbulence. “I was just trying to protect my mental health ― not read the news very much, go cast my vote, tell people to vote,” she said. “I just knew what I could handle and I knew what I couldn’t.

And if BeeJay’s numerous fans and admirers online are any indication, he’ll have no trouble finding a home. // 📸: Courtney Smith/Morris Animal Refuge", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b82671c533ccc9a2948a8ddd7343c54b/5E653462/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67164917_238292020464337_5519934195023750870_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1ghfvxgo4q/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/746dd088707023bc94a1c1a91a7d180e/5DC1F3D9/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67367244_515687702516006_9008731167613234354_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1esZYmHkAl/", "caption": "Actress Alyssa Milano opened up this week about having two abortions in 1993 when her career was just kicking off. “I knew at that time, I was not equipped to be a mother, and so I chose to have an abortion,” the actress said in a Tuesday episode of her podcast “Sorry Not Sorry.” “I chose. It was my choice. And it was absolutely the right choice for me.” Milano said she became pregnant twice, within months of one another, in her early 20s right as her career was taking off, although she was taking the birth control pill. “They tell you the pill is 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancies and yet, a few months later I found out I was pregnant again,” she continued. “So, I had done what I knew to do to prevent pregnancy and was still pregnant. So, once again I made the right decision to end that pregnancy.” “It was not an easy choice. It was not something I wanted, but it was something that I needed, like most health care is,” she added. Milano, known best for her work on TV show “Charmed,” has become an outspoken advocate for women since the Me Too movement took off in 2017. Since then, she has repeatedly pushed for gender equality in politics, reproductive health and more. Although she knew her decision to get her abortions was the right choice, it was still “devastating,” Milano said in the podcast. “I was raised Catholic and was suddenly put in conflict with my faith,” she continued. “A faith I was coming to realize empowered only men to make every single decision about what was allowed and what was not allowed.” Milano’s podcast discussion comes in the wake of several states passing abortion bans or extreme restrictions. States including Alabama, Georgia, Ohio and Missouri have all banned abortion as early as the first trimester. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7a823096f3a84709b1fa10c92802e5de/5E5D6DD2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/69403186_1146599418859178_8032494340354965032_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1eY_3xnD8l/", "caption": "Aug. 22 is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day. 💰 It marks the point when Black women’s income finally caught up to earnings of white non-Hispanic men in the previous calendar year. Despite efforts to raise awareness of the pay gap, this year’s Black Women’s Equal Pay Day comes more than two weeks later than last year’s. On average, Black women in America make 61 cents to every dollar a white man makes. Regardless of socioeconomic or education level, Black women work decades longer than white men to match their earnings, according to a study released this month by the National Women’s Law Center. The analysis shows Black women are losing out on $23,653 yearly. Over the course of a 40-year career, that totals $946,120. In order to match the lifetime earnings of a 60-year-old white man, a Black woman would have to work until she’s 86 years old, if they both started working at age 20. The gap is even greater for Black women born outside of the U.S., who make just half the earnings of foreign-born men in this country. A nearly $1 million loss over a decades-long career is “unfathomable,” Jasmine Tucker, director of research at the National Women’s Law Center, told HuffPost. // Read more at the link in bio. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/810af0d5397c23b09c3548245a0a455f/5E5EAE70/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67698978_1191711744345976_8905902711678000321_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1eH8LOnSDf/", "caption": "Awww. 🐶 🍝 💕 🐩 The leading man of Disney’s upcoming live-action “Lady and the Tramp” is already stealing hearts with his soulful eyes, scruffy face and rags-to-riches backstory.

Lana Wachowski, who helmed the first three films with sister Lilly Wachowski, is set to write and direct the sequel that will apparently continue the bullet-dodging adventures of leather aficionados Neo and Trinity, according to Variety. “Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality are even more relevant now. I’m very happy to have these characters back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my brilliant friends,” Wachowski told the outlet in a statement. Screenwriters Aleksandar Hemon and David Mitchell will produce the script alongside Lana Wachowski. The film will reportedly begin production in the beginning of 2020, more than two decades after the first film hit theaters and spawned two sequels, “The Matrix Reloaded” (2003) and “The Matrix Revolutions” (2003). The franchise grossed more than $1.6 billion at the global box office and changed the course of action cinema with its cutting-edge stunt work and special effects. “We could not be more excited to be re-entering the Matrix with Lana,” Warner Bros. Picture Group chairman Toby Emmerich told Variety in a statement. “Lana is a true visionary — a singular and original creative filmmaker — and we are thrilled that she is writing, directing and producing this new chapter in ‘The Matrix’ universe.” Reeves, who’s in the midst of a cultural renaissance — or Reevesisance — with films like “John Wick: Chapter 3” and “Toy Story 4,” hinted that he would be interested in returning only with the Wachowskis at the helm. “They would have to write it and direct it. And then we’d see what the story is, but yeah, I dunno, that’d be weird, but why not?” he told Yahoo back in 2017. He added: “People die, stories don’t.

The announcement comes more than two weeks after the judge presiding over Pantaleo’s disciplinary trial made a nonbinding recommendation for his dismissal. The choice ultimately fell to NYPD Commissioner James O’Neill, who said he made his decision in the last few days. “None of us can take back our decisions, most especially when they lead to the death of another human being,” O’Neill said in a news conference Monday announcing Pantaleo’s firing. Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice said it would not pursue federal civil rights charges against Pantaleo, whose deadly use of an illegal chokehold on Garner ― who cried out “I can’t breathe” ― set off national outrage. The DOJ’s decision was announced right before the applicable five-year statute of limitations expired.⁠\nNew York City’s Civilian Complaint Review Board, which prosecuted the disciplinary case, agreed with the judge’s recommendation that Pantaleo be fired. “The evidence the CCRB’s prosecutors brought forth at trial was more than sufficient to prove that Pantaleo is unfit to serve,” the board said in a statement. “Commissioner O’Neill must uphold this verdict and dismiss Pantaleo from the Department.” O’Neill said Monday that had he been the person arresting Garner, he could have made “similar mistakes.” Ultimately, however, Pantaleo did not follow protocol when dealing with a person resisting arrest and must face the consequences, O’Neill said. “Being a police officer is one of the hardest jobs in the world,” the commissioner said. “That is not a statement to elicit sympathy from those we serve, it’s a fact.” “But an officer’s choices and actions,” he added later, “even made under extreme pressure, matter.” // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7b164a6a4401c707859dd1334df27bf8/5E4D1444/t51.2885-15/e15/c0.0.1079.1079a/s640x640/67486653_843837105986655_4095729579377099774_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1WLGptgelQ/", "caption": "\"Maggie and I met at work 10 years ago, when she was in her late 20s and I in my early 30s, and we clicked right away,\" writes HuffPost Guest Writer Deena Lilygren. \"Even though we had different backgrounds ― I was the married mother of two teenage daughters while she lived in a city apartment ― we were both new English professors at monumental turning points in our lives emotionally and logistically.

The “Crazy Rich Asians” star is featured in the September issue of British Vogue (which was guest-edited by Meghan Markle) as one of 15 “Forces For Change.” In the interview, Chan explained that the industry isn’t as welcoming to projects centered around minorities or women as it should be. “I know the perception is that it’s got a lot easier to make films by or about minorities or women, but it’s actually still difficult,” she said. “I would like to see a real increase in the diversity of people who are in a position to make decisions.” The actress, who is an outspoken advocate for more diverse representation in the industry, went on to point out that “just a handful of people in Hollywood” have the authority to green light projects, and only a small portion are women or minorities. “Until we address those systemic imbalances all the way up the chain, we’ve still got a lot of work to do.” Indeed, behind the camera and beyond, Hollywood still has a lot to do to even the playing field. A 2019 Hollywood diversity report found that from 2011 to 2017, only 1.3 out of every 10 film directors were people of color.

On Sunday, Elman and photographer Linda Blacker released the photos, which show Asian women of all sizes, colors and ages. Now the pics are getting coverage on sites like BuzzFeed and Glamour UK. “I thought this was the perfect way to show the fashion industry what they are missing and demonstrate that Asian women are just as beautiful and fashionable as any other race and we deserve to be included,” Elman told HuffPost. Elman, who’s half Chinese and half white, said she’s often the token Asian at body-positive events and photo shoots. While she’s happy to be there, she knows there’s room for more diversity. By gathering a group of women who represent a wide range of Asian countries, Elman and Blacker wanted to show that Asians are not a monolith: You can’t just cast the same Asian model in every show and act like you have the whole continent covered. “Asian is a very broad category, obviously,” Elman said. “We all don’t look the same.” And in spite of what’s perpetuated in fashion magazines and on runways, Asian women are not always rail-thin, either. “Asians deserve to be represented. Asians deserve to be seen,” Elman wrote in a photo caption. “And all Asians aren’t the stereotype of being small and petite. Being Asian is not one look. Being Asian is not one culture.” // 📸: @scarrednotscared // Read more about the photo shoot and the models at the link in bio.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1467b788be0c8979af59991995373067/5E452B95/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67234758_2080365222271177_2457866906282682311_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B09BxvvgL7P/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2aefcc0b62318d8846689ab6f154754c/5DC170AA/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67220996_147705643004830_3526305098773222939_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B08rqi9ghAo/", "caption": "Fourteen years after its release, “Brokeback Mountain” is seen as a modern classic. The 2005 film was forward-thinking in its portrayal of a gay relationship between two cowboys, prompting some viewers to scrutinize the off-screen lives of its stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger. Gyllenhaal reflected on the impact “Brokeback Mountain” had on his Hollywood career in a forthcoming interview with “Sunday Today.” He also shared a sweet memory about Ledger, who died in 2008 of an accidental drug overdose. “I see people who have joked with me or criticized me about lines I say in that movie — and that’s the thing I loved about Heath,” the “Spider-Man: Far From Home” star told host Willie Geist. “He would never joke.” He continued, “Someone wanted to make a joke about the story or whatever, he was like, ‘No. This about love.’” Directed by Ang Lee and based on the short story by Annie Proulx, “Brokeback Mountain” won three Academy Awards and made Gyllenhaal and Ledger ― both of whom were Oscar-nominated for their performances ― bankable stars. The two men remained close off-screen, too, with Gyllenhaal becoming godfather to Ledger’s daughter, Matilda Rose. In the intervening years, Gyllenhaal has mostly stayed quiet about his friendship with Ledger, telling People in 2016 his co-star’s death “affected me in ways I can’t necessarily put in words or even would want to talk about publicly.” In 2015, he told NPR that he missed Ledger “as a human being,” adding, “I think losing Heath and being a part of a family that was something like the movie, the movie we all made together, makes you see that, makes you appreciate that and hopefully moves you away from the things that really don’t matter to the things that do.” As for “Brokeback Mountain,” Gyllenhaal said in his “Sunday Today” interview that the film “defined my career in different ways” and, for that, he remains grateful. “This little movie we made that meant so much to us has now become not ours anymore,” he said. “It’s the world’s.” // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3f11170545cf51bb92d6e40cfc109462/5E4A49BC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/66690127_192118245115222_533797305810918028_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B06t0_BAwXO/", "caption": "So true. 💖 Actor Rumer Willis (@rumerwillis) knows what it's like to grow up in the spotlight.

Matthew Mason of Turlock, California, is urging the city of Modesto to reject a permit for the Stanislaus County Straight Pride Parade/Event, which was submitted last month by a group calling itself the National Straight Pride Coalition. His adoptive and estranged mother, Mylinda Mason, is working alongside Don Grundmann, a chiropractor who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate, to coordinate the Aug. 24 event, which is to be held at Modesto’s Graceada Park. Matthew told The Modesto Bee that he supports the right to free speech and peaceful assembly, but he believes the “straight pride” event has the potential to spark violence given its racist, anti-LGBTQ slant. On its website, the National Straight Pride Coalition describes “Caucasians” as being “the biological majority of the historical developers and founders of Western Civilization.” It also argues “current and future generations” are at risk of “being destroyed by the inherent malevolence of the Homosexual Movement.” “This isn’t ‘straight pride.’ This is hate pride,” Matthew said, according to Fox 40. “Dog whistling to white supremacy... This is not a positive message and this community is committed to positivity, to love, to inclusion and to diversity.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fc1864cdb4774009446f067d1729fe39/5E51C926/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66831283_429749010969311_2004282341518805388_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B06ApUfAasT/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ebf3c2dddb415e48abc312df25714534/5DC17F65/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/64782851_186801335661022_5013696128915981088_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B052aByAoAZ/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/42d4768ea880c96a57ebe5df286940eb/5DC1E597/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66464858_144688273396586_5171715855491156376_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B04GNkTF-ui/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/51efc6aef4c0e59802658af232ea247d/5DC20019/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67114481_357502908537530_1042861508015834668_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B04Ac48licH/", "caption": "Rep.

FX made the announcement during the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Tuesday, according to reports from Variety and The Hollywood Reporter. The season will be based on a book by author and attorney Jeffrey Toobin, “A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President.” The network said it had cast Beanie Feldstein, of “Booksmart” fame, as former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, with Sarah Paulson as Lewinsky confidante Linda Tripp and Annaleigh Ashford as sexual harassment accuser Paula Jones. John Landgraf, the chairman of FX Networks and FX Productions, in a release on Tuesday called “American Crime Story” a “cultural touchstone” that delved into the O.J. Simpson trial and Andrew Cunanan’s assassination of designer Gianni Versace in its first two seasons. “This franchise re-examines some of the most complicated, polarizing stories in recent history in a way that is relevant, nuanced and entertaining,” Landgraf said. He continued: ”‘Impeachment: American Crime Story’ will likewise explore the overlooked dimensions of the women who found themselves caught up in the scandal and political war that cast a long shadow over the Clinton Presidency.” Executive producer Ryan Murphy first optioned Toobin’s book in January 2017 but later expressed concerns about telling Lewinsky’s story. “I told her, ‘Nobody should tell your story but you, and it’s kind of gross if they do,’” Murphy told The Hollywood Reporter last year. “If you want to produce it with me, I would love that; but you should be the producer and you should make all the goddamn money.’” Lewinsky has been increasingly vocal in recent years about her brief affair with Clinton leading up to his impeachment trial, as well as the ensuing years of harassment she experienced. // 📸: Getty Images ⁠\n⁠\n⁠", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/50ff00b1b0f9f465f8a6f02bc49a354f/5E45C7FC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/68817933_423866868552450_6759453999222360408_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B03XULYgckU/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/44760b9e5f2c24a9277da126df9c76fe/5DC1EC3F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/65931748_2557999317571419_2499109595589043839_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B03Sw38H1Hw/", "caption": "\"I am drowning in more than $120,000 of student debt after being defrauded by a for-profit college, and I refuse to wait for relief from the Trump administration,\" writes HuffPost Guest Writer Ami Schneider. \"That’s why I am going on the offense and suing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.

Someone remembered it was me who ‘invented’ the gender reveal party,” she wrote, adding that the trend “just exploded into crazy after that.” “Who cares what gender the baby is?” she added. “I did at the time because we didn’t live in 2019 and didn’t know what we know now ― that assigning focus on gender at birth leaves out so much of their potential and talents that have nothing to do with what’s between their legs.” The post ends on a sweet, surprising note: “PLOT TWIST, the world’s first gender-reveal party baby is a girl who wears suits!” The post currently has more than 16,000 “likes” and a comment section full of support. “Bravo to your child for being their true, authentic self, and bravo to you for finding the courage and love to support,” one woman wrote. “As a trans person who felt trapped and confined to those between the leg bits until I was approaching 30 ― Thank.

The 2005 film was forward-thinking in its portrayal of a gay relationship between two cowboys, prompting some viewers to scrutinize the off-screen lives of its stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger. Gyllenhaal reflected on the impact “Brokeback Mountain” had on his Hollywood career in a forthcoming interview with “Sunday Today.” He also shared a sweet memory about Ledger, who died in 2008 of an accidental drug overdose. “I see people who have joked with me or criticized me about lines I say in that movie — and that’s the thing I loved about Heath,” the “Spider-Man: Far From Home” star told host Willie Geist. “He would never joke.” He continued, “Someone wanted to make a joke about the story or whatever, he was like, ‘No. This about love.’” Directed by Ang Lee and based on the short story by Annie Proulx, “Brokeback Mountain” won three Academy Awards and made Gyllenhaal and Ledger ― both of whom were Oscar-nominated for their performances ― bankable stars. The two men remained close off-screen, too, with Gyllenhaal becoming godfather to Ledger’s daughter, Matilda Rose. In the intervening years, Gyllenhaal has mostly stayed quiet about his friendship with Ledger, telling People in 2016 his co-star’s death “affected me in ways I can’t necessarily put in words or even would want to talk about publicly.” In 2015, he told NPR that he missed Ledger “as a human being,” adding, “I think losing Heath and being a part of a family that was something like the movie, the movie we all made together, makes you see that, makes you appreciate that and hopefully moves you away from the things that really don’t matter to the things that do.” As for “Brokeback Mountain,” Gyllenhaal said in his “Sunday Today” interview that the film “defined my career in different ways” and, for that, he remains grateful. “This little movie we made that meant so much to us has now become not ours anymore,” he said. “It’s the world’s.” // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/10dda6fa131497d3d27f30c55ca72060/5E457913/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/65292425_543083232895359_8610707855559131310_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0gVIJanqQ2/", "caption": "The organizers of San Francisco’s popular Outside Lands music festival in Golden Gate Park have banned Native American headdresses at the event. “Out of respect for Native American heritage and culture, we do not allow headdresses at Outside Lands,” organizers said in a statement to The San Francisco Chronicle Thursday. “We are committed to creating a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for all.” The music event, which runs from Aug. 9-11, in the past has attracted more than 200,000 attendees.

In his case, one of those pals was none other than fellow pop star Britney Spears. In a Monday appearance on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” the *NSYNC singer recalled the moment he came out as gay to Spears. The conversation took place in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2004 after Spears had tied the knot with childhood friend Jason Alexander in a quickie ceremony. “It was the night that she got married the first time in Vegas to Jason. So I went up to Vegas to kind of see the craziness that was happening,” said Bass, who tied the knot himself with husband Michael Turchin in December 2014. “She was a little upset once she realized what she had done.” “And then she started, like, really crying and, like, she was so upset,” he continued. “So I took her to her room and we were sitting on the bed and she wouldn’t stop crying, so I was like, ‘I’m gay.’” Turns out, Bass’ revelation lightened the mood, at least for a moment. “It made her stop crying,” he said, noting that Spears ― whose marriage to Alexander would be annulled after a mere 55 hours ― was supportive. “She chuckled.” Elsewhere in the interview, Bass opened up about *NSYNC’s performance with Ariana Grande at Coachella in April. “When Ariana Grande calls and says, ‘Hey, will you perform at Coachella on the main stage,’ you say yes,” he said, adding that the noticeably absent Justin Timberlake wanted to be part of the gig “but he was on tour.” As to whether *NSYNC would ever follow in the footsteps of Spears and Christina Aguilera by headlining a Las Vegas residency, Bass said, “I would like that, because I’m having babies next year, so it would be nice to be in one place.

The bill would eliminate student debt entirely for 75% of borrowers and partially for another 20% of borrowers. “[Student loan] debt not only affects the people who try to carry it ― it affects our entire economy,” Warren said at a press conference. “Finding a way to cancel a big chunk of that student loan debt means freeing up young people to do more.” The proposed legislation only addresses existing student debt, not the rising cost of higher education or predatory for-profit colleges, although both Democratic lawmakers aim to address those issues in other legislation. It’s also unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate or be signed by President Donald Trump. But the bill does offer another look at how Warren aims to reshape the education system if she becomes president.

Taveras, state immigration manager for the advocacy group FWD.us, said in a statement. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/72f2aae89f6239b03e7d43929c8f4999/5E5EE9F9/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66623026_462680824531237_4588377137777842710_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0RVxX1pMUA/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b74bad6632e7898537da708a4bce80b5/5DC20CB4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67414365_2207363539376501_8337718285174476121_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0RCez4gOba/", "caption": "We love this sentiment! ⚡️Happy birthday to the one and only Daniel Radcliffe! // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/03a2bd76200e99d1679f5fa8f49ace76/5E487D2F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/65760581_2454462091277464_98650772231077855_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0O_LtIHnmU/", "caption": "Tom Hanks is moving in as your favorite cardigan-clad neighbor in the first trailer for “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.” The actor has some big loafers to fill starring as beloved children’s television icon Fred Rogers in the upcoming film, but from this first look it’s clear that Hanks has done his homework.

Chris Sununu (R) signed a bill into law that requires all public schools to provide free tampons and pads to students. “This legislation is about equality and dignity,” Sununu tweeted. “SB 142 will help ensure young women in New Hampshire public schools will have the freedom to learn without disruption ― and free of shame, or fear of stigma.” The legislation, also known as the period poverty bill, requires menstrual products to be provided in all female and gender-neutral bathrooms in public middle and high schools across the state. Democratic state Rep. Polly Campion, a co-sponsor of the bill, called the legislation an “essential measure for equality” in a Wednesday statement. “Being an adolescent middle or high-schooler is hard enough without the fear and embarrassment of lacking proper care products during the school-day because you cannot afford them,” she said. ”... Providing access to free menstrual care products in public middle and high school bathrooms is not idealistic, it’s a basic, essential measure for equality and is long overdue.” The bill was spearheaded by New Hampshire high school senior Caroline Dillon after she learned about how many people are forced to miss school or work because they can’t afford pads and tampons. Dillon, who worked with Democratic state Sen. Martha Hennessey to draft the measure in March, testified in front of the state Senate’s Education and Workforce Development Committee in February. “It was sad to think about,” Dillon said during the committee hearing, the Concord Monitor reported. “Girls in middle and high school would never dream of telling somebody that they have to miss school or use socks because they can’t pay for pads.” Hennessey thanked Dillon for all of her hard work on the bill in a Wednesday statement. “I am grateful for the hard work of high school student Caroline Dillon, whose advocacy brought this issue to light,” she wrote. “Today’s step forward to address period poverty in New Hampshire would not have been possible without her. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/72e76d63a1873d73682dbab28ce698fe/5E46720B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/66699617_1399751986857492_966810329653741857_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0OgQJ9HHAA/", "caption": "The origin story for LGBTQ superheroes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a long one, and it’s finally coming to a close.

That’ll be her first order of business. She has some ideas.

However, her bisexuality hasn’t been explicitly addressed in the movies thus far, and a previous scene in “Thor: Ragnarok” showing she had a female lover didn’t end up making the final cut.

I would feel tempted to stop this stranger and explain what he could not possibly know: I am no one’s mother. It felt blasphemous to receive well wishes for a holiday I hadn’t earned. However, over the last decade, I’ve learned to simply appreciate these moments of kindness. I smile, say thank you, and keep walking ― even though I do not want kids. This is a personal truth that I’ve gradually begun sharing with people. When someone asks if I have kids, I now say more than no; I add that I don’t want any. Sometimes, I bring it up myself in conversations about goals or potential plans. I’ve become assertive in stating my choice, no longer saying, 'Maybe one day...' Perhaps most importantly, I’m also learning that I do not need to justify my decision; after all, how often is a mother asked to explain her reasons for having kids?\" // Read more at the link in bio. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a20a17dd1d95c9e6e921c7ba48eb89d2/5E6421FE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/65494384_189708112043837_2250688078067595950_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz1j1xpABqa/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0fed70361995826c5a3d66be9c64db49/5DC12518/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/62085889_2380756732041792_7143380041616719118_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz1JZlxprrk/", "caption": "Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) announced a $1 billion proposal to end the backlog of untested rape kits if she were to win the 2020 presidential election. “The federal government can and should prioritize justice for survivors of sex abuse, assault and rape,” the presidential hopeful said in a press release. Harris’ proposal would pay for states to test all their backlogged rape kits within the first four years of her presidency. The $1 billion investment would also go towards enacting reforms in the criminal justice system to prevent any future backlogs. Under her proposal, states would be required to count and report the number of untested rape kits on an annual basis; implement shorter time frames to test collected kits; track kits and provide survivors with information on the status of their kit; and increase access to rape kits in rural areas. “As California’s Attorney General, I committed resources and attention to clearing a backlog of 1,300 untested rape kits at state-run labs, and we got it done within my first year in office,” Harris continued. “We need the same focus at the national level to pursue justice and help hold predators accountable.” In the last decade, 225,000 untested rape kits have been uncovered, according to End The Backlog, an initiative of the national nonprofit the Joyful Heart Foundation. A rape kit is created during a medical exam to collect physical evidence left on a survivor’s body after an assault. Once a rape kit is compiled at a hospital, it is sent to police to be tested for DNA, which can then be used to prosecute the attacker and, in some cases, identify serial predators. All too often, however, these rape kits ― which cost between $1,000 and $1,500 to test ― end up sitting untested in law enforcement facilities around the country due to inadequate resources or funding. // 📸: Getty Images ⁠\n⁠", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/53472f3e8b128de1858ad7ea0fdef73c/5E51AB9A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66639965_705638403215074_7313166416448624460_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0lrqfj5L6/", "caption": "This is highly relatable #content!!!!!! 👏 In a charming video Jennifer Garner shared on Instagram, the actress talked to her sweatpants as she prepared for a trip: “Who gets to come?

It’s an important battle to fight and she’s not alone.” Huey also dealt with a slew of racist comments after being cast in the role of Ariel. She told WKBW in 2017 that when a photo of her wearing a red wig and mermaid tail was released, “within the first few minutes there was a very negative comment from someone in the community just like, ‘Since when is Ariel Asian? I’m not going to be seeing this anymore, keep it classic.’” Since then, Huey’s received a great deal of love for her depiction of the role, she told The Wrap. Diversity in casting is necessary to “make the world just a more open-minded place,” she said. “I never had one kid in 300-something shows over the course of a year say, ‘Oh, you don’t look like Ariel,’” she told the outlet. “They would see me come out of the stage door with my hair and street clothes and throw themselves at me screaming. ‘Ariel!’ when I looked like Diana.” // 📸: @the5thavenuetheatre and Getty Images ⁠", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/47da73e10889788fc1cee4a333803edd/5E44D7DF/t51.2885-15/e15/c0.90.720.720a/s640x640/65311412_481578105935931_6242415704912435460_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BztS648Hn50/", "caption": "YES! ⚡️ Mindy Kaling celebrated the Fourth of July holiday with an awesome body positive message. “[I don’t know] who needs to hear this but… WEAR A BIKINI IF YOU WANT TO WEAR A BIKINI.

Gov. David Ige signed House Bill 1165 into law on Wednesday. It adds a new gender option beyond “male” and “female” on application forms for driver’s licenses and state IDs. Ige signed the bill along with two other pieces of legislation that focus on LGBTQ rights. Starting July 1, 2020, Hawaii residents will see a third gender option, “X,” on these forms. The legislation aims to reduce discrimination against nonbinary individuals who do not identify exclusively as male or female. The new law also notes that individuals who opt for “X” will not have to provide any documentation to prove their gender. Khara Jabola-Carolus, executive director of the Hawai’i State Commission on the Status of Women, said the new law falls in line with gender inclusivity that was inherent for Native Hawaiians. “This wasn’t just about simple recognition of transgender folks by the mainstream,” Jabola-Carolus said in an Instagram post. “It was about [the] decolonization of the status of gender minorities and women, and taking a step to honor the inclusive society of Native Hawaiians.”⁠\n⁠", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5cb9e3a35aaa2c074bd9a7f3637fe996/5E44AD8A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/64766404_482085935861842_3704441290976458794_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzTxWeplVFa/", "caption": "OMG! 🥰 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were all smiles during their appearance at the Boston Red Sox vs. New York Yankees game in London, the first-ever regular season MLB game held in Europe.

Apart from water access issues, she also expects an increase in violent storms and food scarcity in the future. “I can walk down the street and get a million different kinds of cuisines, and in the supermarket there’s an incredible selection of fruits and vegetables,” she says. “I think that may not always be the case.” In her work, Anders has looked further still into the future: Her new novel, “The City in the Middle of the Night,” is set on another planet threatened by climate change, centuries after humans relocated from a presumably dying Earth. It’s a rather bleak image ― not the shiny techno-utopian futurism that promised us flying hoverboards. “There’s this discussion that always goes on in speculative fiction about whether you write optimistic or pessimistic stories,” she says, “or whether we can have the optimism of the old days of ‘Star Trek’ — this idea that we’re going to build a better future. And have we lost that? Can we get that back?” “I always say that optimism and pessimism about the future really boiled down to optimism and pessimism about human nature. Are we going to destroy ourselves? Or are we going to be able to work together and fix some of the problems that we’ve caused?” Anders describes herself as a realist: “It’s a little of column A, and it’s a little of column B.” It’s not a brave new world, or even a “Brave New World,” but something messy in between. // Read more at the link in bio. // 📸: @kingtexas // #ProudOutLoud", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/eeb44aabe9a15153da012d207fddfd9d/5E50CA05/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.104.1080.1080a/s640x640/64616088_316493729295049_4102244875257400320_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzRx4W4Iu4u/", "caption": "At times, it gets lonely for Michael Lolis, the only out police officer in Greece.

International viewers don’t need to stress, as those streaming deals will remain in place for the time being. However, the decision to remove “The Office” from Netflix, where it is very popular, could be the start of a general exodus of programming.

The bill, which earmarks almost $3 billion for the care of unaccompanied migrant children in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and more than $1 billion for the provision of shelter and food for migrants detained by the U.S. Border Patrol, passed by a mostly party-line vote of 230 to 195. Four Democrats, including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, remained vehemently opposed to the bill ― which they said enabled President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda, regardless of the restrictions included within ― and voted no. Explaining the bill’s purpose, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the package — which stipulated new health and safety standards for migrants in the government’s care — ensures that detainees have access to basic necessities like “food, clothing, sanitary items, shelter, and medical care.” “We are providing access to legal assistance. And we are protecting families because families belong together,” Pelosi added. The fate of the bill, however, is uncertain. The White House has threatened to veto the package over what it described as unnecessary restrictions. The bill, for instance, includes a limit on the amount of time children can be held by the HHS in “influx shelters” and demands that Customs and Border Protection establish better protocols for the provision of medical care, food and other necessities to migrants. // 📸: Getty Images ⁠// Read more at the link in bio. ⁠", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5cde9cf954359f3e3650b797360ba701/5E619C85/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/64478914_2271604333101026_7266627290549436071_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLPGAJnY1v/", "caption": "When life gives you lemons, make cheesecake?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, unveiled one of his signature policy proposals Monday, a plan to make public college free ― with a new element of eliminating all the student debt in the country. The legislation is the most sweeping college affordability plan to date. It eliminates tuition and fees at public four-year colleges and universities, as well as community colleges. It also would wipe out all the existing student debt ― $1.6 trillion, covering 45 million Americans. Sanders’ plan, which was shared in advance with HuffPost, goes further than what Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) ― who, along with Sanders, occupies the progressive lane in the 2020 race — has proposed. While the two will be on different nights for this week’s first Democratic presidential debates, it introduces a key difference in approach on a prominent policy issue. The Sanders bill eliminates all student debt, whereas Warren’s plan ― while still substantial ― covers $1.25 trillion for 42 million people. The difference is that Warren’s plan has caps. Warren’s proposal forgives $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with a household income of $100,000. People between $100,000 and $250,000 in household income would have a portion of their debt forgiven, and people above that amount would get no cancellation. Once she released her plan in April, Warren made forgiving college debt a major issue in the presidential campaign. It’s been one of her most high-profile policy proposals. In the House, Sanders is joined by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), whose Student Debt Cancellation Act would cancel all existing federal and private student loans, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), whose College for All Act would cover the free college aspect. The three held a news conference Monday morning outside the Capitol with others, including Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, and several people who would have their student debt forgiven under the plans. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9732db455d330962e2ac98c90cbfb445/5E52EFD3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/64527146_175910986761350_8457016258429288363_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzIb63LjMOh/", "caption": "Today we remember and honor Anthony Bourdain who would have been 63 years old on this day.

It was another way for Jackson, who runs the multipronged environmental and humanitarian charity Planting Peace, to give back ― and it was just the first of many campaigns he launched to benefit members of the LGBTQ community. Jackson, who identifies as an ally of the LGBTQ community, has also sent a pride flag into outer space and planted another pride flag in Antarctica ― both acts aimed at raising visibility ― and after the Pulse nightclub massacre in 2016, Jackson gave a college scholarship to a young woman who was a victim of the horrific mass shooting. “I got an update about her progress, and it reminded me of the importance of giving someone a chance to make something of themselves,” he told HuffPost Wednesday. “If we can, we should all help lift each other up.”It’s that attitude that recently led Jackson to offer yet another scholarship to a deserving young queer person ― this time to transgender teen and activist Gavin Grimm. Grimm first made headlines in 2018 when he filed a lawsuit against his school to use the bathroom aligned with his gender. In May, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia denied a motion to dismiss the case, and a hearing is now scheduled for July 23. In a Facebook post, Grimm expressed his gratitude to Jackson for the scholarship. “I received word of this just this evening and my heart still hasn’t stopped racing,” he wrote. “I can’t express how grateful I feel to have my work and my life supported in such a significant way. The enormous gift of not staring down crippling educational debt as I enter the workforce as a teacher is something I can never hope to pay forward enough.” // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/133aab6e73b1580cc97a28dcd059f27e/5E4DFDE8/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/64565446_879035709110795_6208099339505222677_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzDO4QOgRjJ/", "caption": "Sen. Cory Booker’s (D-N.J.) presidential campaign on Thursday unveiled a plan that would grant clemency and early release to thousands of federal drug offenders “serving unjust and excessive sentences.” Under the plan, Booker would “initiate” the clemency process for roughly 17,000 federal prisoners on his first day in office and set up a bipartisan panel that would “operate with a presumption of a recommendation of clemency,” though screen out certain individuals who may “pose a threat to public safety” based on the details of their cases or their prison history. Booker’s plan, the Restoring Justice Initiative, focuses on three categories of prisoners: those serving primarily for marijuana charges; those who would have had shorter sentences if they were sentenced after the passage of the First Step Act, a law signed by President Donald Trump that offers some limited prison reforms and gives federal prisoners a chance to earn more days off for good behavior each year; and those who have longer sentences due to the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. \"The War on Drugs has been a war on people, tearing families apart, ruining lives, and disproportionately affecting people of color and low-income individuals — all without making us safer,” Booker said in a statement. “As president, I will act immediately to right these wrongs, starting by initiating a clemency process for thousands of nonviolent drug offenders who have been handed unjust sentences by their government.” President Barack Obama commuted the sentences of more than 1,700 federal prisoners over the course of his presidency. But Obama’s clemency initiative, which worked through the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney, faced some bureaucratic hurdles that blunted its impact. Booker’s plan includes the formation of an executive clemency panel, which is intended to “revamp and streamline the clemency process.” That panel, set up by the Office of the White House Counsel, would largely remove DOJ’s Office of the Pardon Attorney from the process. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b900bebece3fd3912d661b23bb8be0e8/5E5E912B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/62253726_380962102543495_2730721096187550724_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzBxm1XgQ0y/", "caption": "The world of truck driving has long been a male-dominated industry, but that didn’t stop Nic and Carla Richelle. They’re a married, queer truck-driving couple who created a popular YouTube channel about their life on the road. The pair met at a job in a call center where Carla was Nic’s boss. As they describe it, things between them soon “got a little spicy” and they started dating. After getting married in November 2018, they decided to quit their 9-5 jobs in the call center in order to become professional truckers. Trucking was their way to both work and travel together. After solidifying the idea as a New Year’s resolution on Jan. 1, 2018, they moved out of their home in Courtland, Alabama, got rid of most of their possessions and put a few important items in storage. Now they live their lives permanently on the road, with no home base. Their truck has a bed and kitchen set up for when they’re running loads. And when they’re not working, the couple checks in to hotels in whatever city they happen to be in. This nomadic lifestyle is exactly the sort of freedom they sought when they left the call center world. Nic and Carla stand out in the trucking industry for many reasons ― their race, gender, sexuality and their marriage. “What’s most common in trucking are solo drivers... That’s why we’re the cream of the crop, because if you find not only a team, but if you find a married couple and they’re driving trucks, you’ve really hit it big because we bring in more revenue for the company, because we’re always running,” Nic said. // Read more at the link in bio. // #ProudOutLoud // 📸: @lnweatherspoon", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/07892d217fba726640c59e1a7fb71b87/5E5C55F3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.104.1080.1080a/s640x640/64394712_425243494997944_5922469939289428429_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzBOIgpgXof/", "caption": "Do you think Jason Momoa and Peter Dinklage could do a remake of the movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito?

In the play, Blackwell is Dionysus, coming out of hiding because he realizes the earth is being destroyed. “If I don’t step in now there will be no humans left on Earth to worship me … It’s time for a comeback!” He lands in a Jersey suburb, takes the form of a butch lesbian landscaper named Diane and tries to reboot his Bacchanalia by enthralling four married, bored, upper-middle-class women. “It’s a crazy role because I have to come out and be a demigod, but then, like most butches, I end up doing a lot of the listening,” Blackwell says. “So to make that happen, I have to come out really strong right at the start.” George wrote the role with Blackwell in mind. “I had in mind the kind of unassuming individual in many-pocketed pants and a nothing-to-see-here haircut … who can mesmerize a straight woman with her level gaze and infinite competency in a way that the straight woman herself can’t quite identify,” says George, “and Becca was just the most obvious actor in New York to channel that kind of mojo.” // Read more at the link in bio. // 📸: @laurelgolio﻿\n﻿", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/021e0dd70f0cf3524b95d3db3ba9f5e8/5E58B4D5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.104.1080.1080a/s640x640/62243793_2060021994293986_3688161131647153470_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/By5-GIBHqCi/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7397508d4f1178385e3f2f502891d87d/5DC1FD84/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/65265461_143728313472003_4418307015130648906_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/By5vCMEp9A7/", "caption": "Meghan Markle may be on maternity leave, but she still has time to support a patronage that’s near and dear to her heart.

The former “Suits” actress spoke about the “joy” of rescuing an animal. “As a proud rescue dog owner, I know from personal experience the joy that adopting an animal into your home can bring,” the Duchess said, before talking about the patronage. “The role that we, as people, play in rehoming and rescuing these animals is vital, but the role of organisations such as Mayhew is unparalleled.” She encouraged people to get involved with animals and Mayhew in any form, whether its adopting an animal or volunteering one’s time. “The choice to adopt a pet is a big decision that comes with much responsibility but infinite return on investment,” she added. “It will undoubtedly change your life.” Meghan previously adopted two rescue dogs, a beagle named Guy and a labrador-shepherd Bogart, in Toronto. Only Guy made it across the pond when the duchess moved to London, while Bogart stayed behind with some of her friends. // Read more at the link in bio. // 📸: Getty Images ﻿\n﻿", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c052122861ca1d09494c506dcc9f25d7/5E4F2D02/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/65194663_184929105835993_2750661513202601782_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/By5UeGzgRSx/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/665dda46f4900d5bb6711e06f7011e64/5DC18F96/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/62265791_345477739405627_5803732003518647059_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/By5Pr9fge0y/", "caption": "Nenookaasi Ogichidaa (@nenookaasi), or “hummingbird warrior” in Ojibwe, is a two-spirit powwow dancer who is Black, Ukranian and Ojibwe, a First Nation based in Canada and the U.S. Two-spirit is an umbrella term that Indigenous people from North America use to describe their place on a spectrum of genders and sexualities.

Legend teamed up with Pampers and Koala Kare in a pledge to provide 5,000 changing tables in men’s public restrooms across North America over the next two years. “I think it’s, as George W. Bush said, ‘the soft bigotry of low expectations.’ So much more is expected of women, and so little is expected of men. Every time a man does even the smallest thing, everyone’s like, ‘Oh, that’s so amazing, he’s such a great dad,’” he told HuffPost. “Meanwhile, women are doing lots more, and it’s assumed that’s what they’re supposed to do,” he added. “They’re not celebrated for it.

The Stop Violence in the Sex Trades Act is a legislative package that “decriminalizes and decarcerates” the sex trade in New York, according to a press release from organizers at the Decrim NY coalition. If passed, it would be the first measure in the country to legalize prostitution statewide. “Sex work is work and should not be criminalized by the state,” state Sen. Julia Salazar (D) said at a Monday press conference. “Our current policies only empower traffickers and others who benefit from keeping sex work in the shadows,” Salazar added. “New York state needs to listen to sex workers and make these common-sense reforms to keep sex workers safe and empower sex workers in their workplaces.” New York currently has over a dozen anti-sex-work statutes, according to Decrim NY. Under the new legislation, laws that criminalize the sale and purchase of sex between two consenting adults would be repealed. Laws that protect victims of human trafficking, sexual assault, harassment, battery and statutory rape would stay on the books. The bill would give sex workers and trafficking survivors the option to apply for the expunging of any criminal record of prostitution. Additionally, the measure would edit the gendered language of the remaining anti-prostitution laws ― which focus largely on cisgender women ― to include LGBTQ people, who participate in sex work at higher rates. The legislation is co-sponsored by Salazar, state Rep. Richard Gottfried (D), state Rep. Yuh-Line Niou (D) and state Sen.

His selection as ambassador is pretty spot on. Van Ness has used fashion and beauty as a means of expression on Capitol Hill and on the red carpet alike. The capitalization and monetization of Pride Month are widespread and problematic, with brands continually using the annual celebration as an opportunity to shill their products. But in this instance, even if the partnership isn’t totally altruistic (for example, Essie is partaking in some Pride Month events but isn’t donating proceeds from its polish to LGBTQ charities as part of the partnership), at the very least it’s increasing representation and furthering the message that beauty and fashion are not entities only women should feel comfortable enjoying. Essie follows in the steps of Cover Girl, which made waves when it named (now embroiled in controversy) James Charles as its first “CoverBoy” back in 2016. That sentiment resonates in the comments section of Van Ness’ post, with at least one follower praising his role in shifting the narrative. “My 3yo son loves to wear polish and I’m so glad we are all (hopefully) relaxing these messed up ideas we have about what people can and can’t do!” the commenter said. // Words: @realgirlproject // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/00c003effbedb1b97cb4ace26d3e8c88/5E53B5AD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/61390924_2313224505437191_5196303597827216532_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BybDsiDpSGK/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2b0e5c176a277555e4c455ca4e96c0b5/5DC0F0DA/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/60796078_896454874080027_6062835178702025745_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByawbPVFp9T/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b39aaf42e825fb30f7437d67f9f037ca/5DC1E8FB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/61763709_2144053899025147_1282557783967721120_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Byaj2-qld18/", "caption": "Who gets to be a superhero?

At the time, most states had anti-sodomy laws in place, effectively rendering homosexuality illegal, and such raids on LGBTQ establishments were common. The event has come to be viewed as the symbolic start of the modern LGBTQ rights movement. In 2016, President Barack Obama designated the inn and its environs in Manhattan’s West Village neighborhood as the country’s first national monument to LGBTQ rights.

It may have been a response to news that organizers in Boston are planning to hold a “straight pride parade” in August, as Pride.com noted. “Straight Pride Parade?????” read the tweet from the band’s official account. “FUCK OFF!!!!!!!!” (That’s five question marks and eight exclamation points, for those keeping score.) A spokesperson at the Boston mayor’s press office said the group planning to host the “straight pride” parade has been in contact with city officials, but has not yet received the permits it would need for the event. Meanwhile, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh released a statement supporting the city’s LGBTQ community and its upcoming pride events. “Every year Boston hosts our annual Pride Week, where our city comes together to celebrate the diversity, strength and acceptance of our LGBTQ community,” Walsh said. “This is a special week that represents Boston’s values of love and inclusion, which are unwavering. I encourage everyone to join us in celebration this Saturday for the Pride Parade and in the fight for progress and equality for all.” Whatever the genesis of Smash Mouth’s tweet, it didn’t matter to the many Twitter users who approved of the message and added their own comments. // 📸: Getty Images // News: David Moye⠀", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/450f4ae09192b4af5d161e6493d35276/5E62250B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/61384318_208525686780617_8238167902456105875_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWZ2S8gJ7U/", "caption": "Serena Williams has become the first athlete to make Forbes’ annual list of the richest self-made women. The magazine announced the tennis star’s accomplishment on Monday, one day ahead of the publication of its full 2019 list. Forbes estimates that Williams ― who will also be featured on the cover of its June 30 special issue ― has an estimated fortune of $225 million. Though she’s known as a 23-time Grand Slam champion, Williams is also a venture capitalist. In April, she publicly announced her venture firm, Serena Ventures, which she’s been running in “secret” since 2014. “Serena Ventures invests in companies that embrace diverse leadership, individual empowerment, creativity and opportunity,” she wrote in her Instagram announcement. The venture firm launched a self-funded clothing line called S by Serena last May, Forbes reported. Speaking about her venture firm, brands and investments, which include the dating app Bumble and a list of over 30 startups, according to Forbes, she told the magazine: “I want to be a part of it. I want to be in the infrastructure. I want to be the brand, instead of just being the face.” Forbes reports that 60% of the Williams’ investments have gone to companies led by women or people of color.

The rapper and businessman has made history as hip-hop’s first billionaire, according to a new Forbes cover story published on Monday. The magazine conservatively estimates his fortune totals more than $1 billion. While Forbes has been historically opaque about its wealth calculations of the rich and famous, the report details various assets and investments that have reaped some serious profits for Jay-Z. Apart from his two-plus-decade music career that boasts a $75 million catalog, a host of high-grossing tours, his own record label and streaming service, the rapper has made major money moves in the art, fashion, liquor and tech sectors. The report claims the Brooklyn-born entertainer holds a $310 million stake in the luxury champagne brand Armand de Brignac, which he acquired in 2014, as well as another $100 million in his cognac label D’Ussé that reportedly continues to grow 80% each year. His cash portfolio also tallies at $220 million, according to Forbes, in part thanks to a stake in Uber worth an estimated $70 million. The rapper previously sold his clothing line Rocawear, which he launched in 1999, to Iconix for $204 million in 2007. And finally, the rapper’s real estate properties around the world and extensive art collection, which counts several works by the artist Basquiat, have an estimated value of $120 million. Jay-Z has often self-identified as a billionaire in a number of songs since releasing his now classic debut album “Reasonable Doubt” in 1996. “Ain’t no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I’m cute,” he rapped on the track “Family Feud” off his most recent solo effort “4:44.” While Forbes rates the “Everything Is Love” artist as the first rapper to reach the billionaire benchmark, some of his contemporaries don’t trail too far behind. Dr. Dre previously declared he was hip-hop’s first billionaire. The Beats by Dre founder did sell his brand to Apple in back in 2014 for $3.2 billion, but Forbes claims his net worth actually hovers closer to $700 million after taxes. // 📸: Getty Images // News: @coledelbyck ⠀\n⠀", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/98ed5adf2a572f26ae0c0595b21b058f/5E47EC70/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/60864058_1033234580206774_8949662422625989798_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByQZYJrjjSH/", "caption": "Sophie Turner and Jessica Chastain are part of a growing list of celebrities who say they will not work in states that have recently enacted strict anti-abortion legislation. “There’s a letter going around that I signed saying I’m not going to work in any state that denies rights for women, for the LGBTQ community, for anyone,” Chastain told the U.K.’s Sky News in an interview. “I’m not going to work in a state that discriminates.” Turner added that she signed the letter as well, telling Sky News: “I have yet to tell my agents I signed it. They’re going to be like: ‘What? You can’t work in these states?’ Yeah I can’t work in these states.” The “X-Men: Dark Phoenix” stars signed the letter after it was published in March to combat Georgia’s extreme anti-abortion “heartbeat bill” passed earlier this month. The legislation effectively bans abortion after six weeks, a time at which many women are not yet aware they’re pregnant. The letter, spearheaded by Alyssa Milano, includes signatures from A-list actors including Laverne Cox, Amy Schumer, Gabrielle Union, Ben Stiller and Don Cheadle. “We want to stay in Georgia,” the letter reads. “We want to continue to support the wonderful people, businesses and communities we have come to love in the Peach State. But we will not do so silently, and we will do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women if H.B. 481 becomes law.” Film and TV companies have also hopped on the bandwagon to boycott certain states with extreme anti-abortion legislation.

Smith committed himself to paying off the college loans amassed by members of the 2019 graduating class at the Atlanta school. “On behalf of the eight generations of my family who have been in this country, we’re going to put a little fuel in your bus,” he said. “My family is making a grant to eliminate” the student loans. Smith’s news stunned the crowd of nearly 400 graduates, who leapt from their chairs, responding with shouts and applause. Calling the 2019 graduates “my class, he said, “I know my class will make sure they pay this forward.” He challenged the students at the historically black all-male school to “make sure every class has the same opportunity going forward because we are enough to take care of our own community.” He added, “We are enough to ensure we have all the opportunities of the American dream, and we will show it to each other through our actions and through our words and through our deeds.” According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Smith’s family will donate an estimated $40 million to cover the cost of the student loans. In January, Smith gave the school $1.5 million for an endowed scholarship and a new park in which students will be able to study. Smith, 56, was raised in Denver, went to Cornell University as an undergraduate and then to Columbia Business School. Trained as an engineer, he founded Vista Equity Partners, a firm that invests in software companies. Forbes magazine has estimated the company’s assets exceed $46 billion and that Smith’s “real-time net worth” is $5 billion.

The gift comes amid reignited national conversations over unpaid lunch bills in public schools and how the consequences affect kids whose families struggle financially. Valerie Castile gave Cooper High School in New Hope, Minnesota, $8,000 last month to address the school’s unpaid lunch bills. She presented the donation on behalf of a foundation she created in honor of her son, Philando Castile, a black 32-year-old who was a beloved cafeteria supervisor in Minnesota. He was killed in July 2016 during a traffic stop in St. Anthony, Minnesota. The police officer who shot him was acquitted, but the city later paid a $3 million settlement to his family amid protests enflamed by a viral video taken by Castile’s girlfriend as he was dying. The Robbinsdale Area Schools, which includes Cooper High, said in a statement last month that the donation from the Philando Castile Relief Foundation, created with the family’s settlement, reduced the school’s lunch debt by covering unpaid balances for about 100 seniors enrolled in a program that provides free and reduced-priced meals at the school. Some of those students may have had a balance accrue before qualifying for the program, the statement added. “The impact of this donation will reach many students and allow families to focus on celebrating the seniors’ upcoming graduation,” Robbinsdale Area Schools nutrition director Adele Lillie said in a statement. Valerie Castile told NPR that the donation was made in honor of her son, who “understood that the children are the future leaders of this country.” // 📸: Getty Images ⠀\n⠀", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0ce3ea7539ff2540da3719cdcb3f7fad/5E4D33EB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/60468053_331463117561403_2697957270219162438_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxaVMmBDAGX/", "caption": "Happy birthday, Stevie Wonder!

The legendary actress died at her Carmel Valley, California, home surrounded by close friends. Day “had been in excellent physical health for her age, until recently contracting a serious case of pneumonia,” the foundation said in a statement to The Associated Press. Day’s career placed her among America’s sweethearts throughout the ’40s, ’50s and ’60s. Though she withdrew from public life in her later years, Day continued to be an indelible part of pop-culture history. The daughter of a music teacher and homemaker, Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff was born April 3, 1922, in Cincinnati. She changed her name to Day when she began singing on the radio as a teen. Day had a son, Terry, with musician Al Jorden in 1942. Terry, who died in 2004, was later adopted by Day’s third husband, Martin Melcher. (Melcher died in April of 1968.) “All I ever wanted in my life was to get married, have kids, keep house and cook,” Day told Closer magazine in 2014, “and even though I did all these things, I still ended up in Hollywood.” // 📸: Getty Images⠀\n⠀", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fb28fdcf5dc165c594320e628a67c3bf/5E4E4777/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/59652722_197196281257688_8861622405510943579_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxZ1N5Ujly4/", "caption": "Yara Shahidi from the TV series \"Black-ish\" and the film adaptation of \"The Sun Is Also a Star\" recently talked about her identity and her unique perspective to @netaporter. ⚡️// 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/353ada1eac5b427e215b2ae65b73e58f/5E441007/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/58468404_2158622190851874_3250183419464754092_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxX72bDgn34/", "caption": "So real. 💙 Today is the series finale of \"Veep\" on HBO. 🇺🇸 In an interview with USA Today, Julia Louis-Dreyfus reflected on the satirical show and talked about how hard it will be to walk away from it: \"I was so overcome with a joy and grief mashup as this show ended,\" she said. \"I’m an emotional person anyway but I will say it caught me by surprise.\" // 📸: @veephbo", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/97e8ba809ac4f773409c1717e7fd8302/5E52F7DB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/59425392_334761440573895_2944727363771262895_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxXM7jtDHd8/", "caption": "Happy Mother's Day 💐. // 📸: Associated Press", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5a834aac533d28372e260a7e0dbf2f0e/5E4E46AC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/57457124_2234790383503195_1730124306963877469_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxVnDkLgYAC/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5b15490c08bfc38c73126b43d4054b07/5DC11FE1/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/58410820_135181684301478_2658523180544711737_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxU-2xfAihP/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/cae76dc55f4f786111ce89e1335ef668/5DC1779D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/58685000_337665726947315_125761404129928900_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxUrlriF0Qt/", "caption": "Dealing with a mental health issue is hard as hell, but you don’t have to do it alone and you can manage it.

Nobody else. Nobody,” said Philipps at the start of her E! network show “Busy Tonight.” The “Dawson’s Creek” alum began the segment by noting that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the “heartbeat bill” on Tuesday morning, which will severely limit access to abortion for millions of women across the state and bans abortion as soon as doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat. Heartbeats can usually be detected around six weeks into a pregnancy, an early stage when many women are not aware they are even pregnant. Philipps called abortion an “incredibly personal choice” and added that this sort of legislation puts “more women at risk.” “The statistic is 1 in 4 women will have an abortion before age 45. That statistic sometimes surprises people, and maybe you’re sitting there thinking, ‘I don’t know a woman who would have an abortion.’ Well, you know me,” she said, explaining that she had an abortion at 15 years old. “I’m telling you this because I’m genuinely really scared for women and girls all over this country,” she continued. “I think we all need to be talking more and sharing our stories more.” // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8bb851bf726eee5c4703ee1f9a5aecc8/5E4569B4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/59742826_135710794170757_3747078833818980587_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxPc031gYj4/", "caption": "Happy birthday, Rosario Dawson! 🎉 We live for your optimism and strength. 🙌 // 📸: Getty Images // Quote from: Harper's Bazaar ⠀\n⠀", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/975a74ee485fc056d605d9db9c009940/5E645BF2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/58751644_610326019466463_4448198924620110168_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNmkfMlNXY/", "caption": "Perfectly said, Oprah. 🔥 ⚡️ // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5c4625c32554c0322329af0cb41aedeb/5E47AFE4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/58718089_423983131492336_7456532103178463138_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNQWfWFn5N/", "caption": "The royal baby has a name! 🎉 Meet Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.

The eight teenagers from Omaha’s First United Methodist Church spent one year preparing for confirmation, a service during which young members typically reaffirm their Christian faith and take a vow of membership in the UMC, America’s third-largest religious group. But when Confirmation Sunday arrived this week, the junior high school students stood up and announced that they were not going to join the UMC at this time ― protesting that its policies towards LGBTQ members are “immoral.” The teens read out a joint letter explaining their stance during the service, Religion News Service first reported. “We are disappointed about the direction the United Methodist denomination is heading,” the teens wrote in the letter, which was published on First United Methodist’s Facebook page. The teens were referring to a decision made by a special session of the UMC’s General Conference in February. About 53% of delegates to the conference voted in favor of what members call the “Traditional Plan,” which reinforces church doctrine prohibiting same-sex marriage and the ordination of queer clergy. The plan also strengthens penalties for clergy who perform same-sex weddings, according to RNS. Last week, the UMC’s top court upheld most of the Traditional Plan. It is expected to go into effect in January 2020. // Read more at the link in bio. // 📸: AP", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dfc590b60580c7d41de7080777137bb4/5E591F3C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/58698708_414898842395493_2832277425076974812_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw8HvFtoElc/", "caption": "Clad in suffragette white, actress Patricia Arquette delivered a passionate plea for the Equal Rights Amendment at a historic hearing before the House Judiciary Committee.

Seated behind Arquette were several rows of women’s activists, including fellow actress Alyssa Milano. Many wore white, and some had suffragette sashes of purple and green. “There’s a groundswell in this country,” Arquette said. “Women are rising up by the millions and saying they will not be sexually assaulted, they will not be paid less, they will not be treated as subhuman and they will have their voices heard.” The ERA passed Congress in 1972 with bipartisan support, but fell three states short of the 38 required to ratify by the 1982 deadline. At issue Tuesday was a bill, sponsored by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), that would eliminate the deadline. The U.S. is the only industrialized country in the world that does not guarantee equal rights for women in its constitution. Speier called the failure to enshrine women’s rights in the U.S. Constitution a “stain” on the country. “Nations around the world recognize the equality of men and women,” Speier said Tuesday. “It’s frankly an embarrassment.” // 📸: AP", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e9bfb086dd6c37605bfc0cd09f765992/5E632B94/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/58716094_423258741583864_1752949814896259690_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw7uO6UJOKm/", "caption": "Rep.

She told The Los Angeles Times her father used some of the $3.8 million he received from a settlement with the city after the beating to expose her to the wider world﻿, and she hoped the scholarship program would help other fathers spend time with their kids.⁣\nKing also noted that she hoped the effort would remind the city of her father’s legacy. “Who knows if they will ever acknowledge him in the way that they should,” King told the Times. “He really didn’t care for that.

In Hawaii, Columbus Day is Discoverers’ Day, in recognition of the Polynesian discoverers of the Hawaiian Islands. “The shift to Indigenous Peoples’ Day sends a strong message to the descendants of the people who once were sought to be extinguished that there’s a renewed appreciation for their resiliency and contribution to our great state,” New Mexico state Rep. Derrick J. Lente (D) said in a statement after his state changed the holiday. “It is a time to reflect on our understanding of our country’s history, both the good and the bad.” At least 60 cities have also picked up the mantle as well, including Columbus, Ohio. // 📸: Associated Press", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2b3ef4227ee54229d74d244f4b5287e5/5E4C6DC9/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/56478717_668737633575775_2000623465934891020_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwnDPt8Ft72/", "caption": "Happy birthday, Prince Louis! 🎂 Fresh off celebrating Queen Elizabeth II’s 93rd birthday on April 21, the British royal family is already marking another big milestone.

NextAct Cinema, the only black-owned movie theater in the state of Maryland, opened on March 7 and the response has been overwhelming, the owners say. After a few viral posts online and media coverage, moviegoers from all over have shared messages of support and excitement about the theater’s opening. ”I’ve gotten emails from Texas, from Chicago, from South Carolina, from California,” Fykes, 38, told HuffPost. “The support has been very humbling for us because we didn’t know that what we were doing could have such a social impact.”The pair met while working at a healthcare company and have remained good friends throughout the years. When Wright invited Fykes to check out his home theater in Reisterstown, Maryland, he told his future business partner that he’d like to replicate the communal atmosphere his home theater provides on a larger scale, which set the plan for NextAct Cinema in motion. “I have a lot of friends who would prefer to come to [the home theater] during the Super Bowl or when a big movie comes out,” Wright, 41, said. “So it really made me think it’s ... an intimate experience, and it will be really cool if we could do something similar on a larger scale but not too large or people can still have that same experience.” They renovated the Pikes Theatre in Pikesville, Maryland, a suburb northwest of Baltimore, and gave it a brand new look.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) just released a wide-ranging plan to fix the U.S. college system, with proposals including making two-year and four-year public college free and expanding the size and scope of the federal Pell Grant program. And one particularly radical idea is sure to grab the attention of young people around the country: wiping out student loan debt for the vast majority of American borrowers. “The time for half-measures is over,” Warren, one of many politicians and public figures hoping to secure the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, wrote in a post published Monday on Medium. “My broad cancellation plan is a real solution to our student debt crisis. It helps millions of families and removes a weight that’s holding back our economy.” Last year, outstanding student debt in the U.S. topped $1.5 trillion, a growing financial burden that Warren argues is “crushing millions of families and acting as an anchor on our economy.” “It’s reducing home ownership rates,” she wrote. “It’s leading fewer people to start businesses. It’s forcing students to drop out of school before getting a degree. It’s a problem for all of us.” To address the problem, Warren is suggesting what she calls a “truly transformational” approach: wiping out $50,000 in student loan debt for anyone with a household income below $100,000. People with student loans and a household income between $100,000 and $250,000 would receive substantial relief as well. At that point, “the $50,000 cancellation amount phases out by $1 for every $3 in income above $100,000,” Warren wrote. Under Warren’s proposed plan, up to 76 percent of households with student loan debt would receive “total loan forgiveness,” according to an economic analysis of the proposal by academics at Arizona State University, Brandeis University and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Ninety-five percent, or 42 million Americans, would be eligible to have at least some of their debt canceled.

The eight-episode series follows Ryan (played by Ryan O’Connell, also the show’s creator), a 28-year-old gay man with cerebral palsy. Though Ryan has been living out of the closet for years, he soon finds himself ensnared in the confines of a different one when he convinces colleagues at Eggwoke, the fictional news website where he works, that his limp is the result of a car crash rather than a disability. (Catch the series trailer above.) A Los Angeles screenwriter whose credits include MTV’s “Awkward” and NBC’s “Will & Grace” revival, O’Connell based “Special” on his experiences navigating his intersecting identities — many of which he recounted in his 2015 memoir, “I’m Special: And Other Lies We Tell Ourselves.” O’Connell, now 32, came out as gay at age 17. But he didn’t start embracing his true self — that of a queer person with a disability — until he was 28, the same age as the character of Ryan on “Special.” That’s one of many plot points on the series that mirrors his off-screen life. “What happens in the show happened to me,” he told HuffPost. “When I was 20, I was hit by a car … and when I moved to New York to go to school, no one knew me there, and they all thought my limp was from my accident. I never bothered to correct them because I grew up with a mild case of cerebral palsy, and I felt like I never really belonged in the disabled world because … well, because I now know internalized ableism exists.

King, who interviewed Felsenthal, said she was so honored to be included in the list of change-makers. “It’s not even noon and I am having a great day,” King told Felsenthal during the segment. “I am so appreciative and so humbled by this I can’t even begin to tell you.” Other iconic women on this year’s list include former first lady Michelle Obama (whose profile was written by Beyoncé), Dr. Christine Blasey Ford (written by Kamala Harris), and Rep.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) directly told Fox News viewers that President Trump is a “pathological liar.” Here's the full story: “Trump cannot even tell the truth” about something as simple as where his father was born, Sanders said during his Fox News town hall in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. “Whether you’re a conservative or moderate or progressive ... I don’t think the American people are proud that we have a president who is a pathological liar.” The town hall was moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, two anchors considered more neutral on the conservative-leaning network than Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. Sanders took several jabs at Trump on the president’s favorite network, including on issues like immigration, health care and tax plans: “I guess the president watches your network a little bit, right?” Sanders told Baier and MacCallum Monday, to which Baier later said, “We’re giving you an hour of substance, so we can get over the Fox thing.” Despite the jabs, Sanders cautioned Monday that “Democrats are going to lose” if they spend the entire presidential race attacking Trump. Sanders is the first 2020 Democratic candidate to participate in an event like this on Fox. In March, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would not partner with the network for debates during the 2020 primaries because of a New Yorker exposé on Fox’s ties with the Trump administration. The DNC said it had no qualms about Sanders’ decision to have a Fox town hall. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/996c322d5a600d641e0069a97e81601c/5E424E2B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/56492680_130461808116074_8018151234196835460_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWwexTgpof/", "caption": "YUUUUUP. 👀 Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s name is on the lips of nearly everyone at Fox News. A study found that the New York City Democrat was mentioned 3,181 times on Fox News Channel and its sister Fox Business Network during the six-week period of Feb. 25 to April 7, or just under 76 times a day. Not a day went by when she wasn’t spoken about on Fox. The liberal watchdog Media Matters for America, which did the research, called it an obsession and said the first term representative has become the network’s latest bogeyman, “someone for hosts and guests to demonize, knock down and refer to whenever grievances need to be aired against the Democratic Party.” Media Matters for America did not analyze other news shows for this report. Its mission is to monitor conservative news in the U.S. media. Fox has talked about Ocasio-Cortez’s advocacy for a Green New Deal, called her a hypocrite for using cars and has fed off her social media pronouncements. Fox’s Sean Hannity called her “the real speaker of the House,” instead of Nancy Pelosi. Tucker Carlson has called her an “idiot wind bag,” a “pompous little twit,” a “fake revolutionary,” ″self-involved and dumb,” a “moron and nasty and more self-righteous than any televangelist.” Fox personalities like Carlson and Jeanine Pirro have called her “a bartender,” in reference to a pre-politics job. There are also derogatory allusions to her youth, like when commentator Brit Hume said that “she’s kind of adorable in sort of the way that a 5-year-old child can be adorable,” according to the research. Asked for comment on Saturday, a Fox spokeswoman noted that Ocasio-Cortez, 29, has received plenty of media attention elsewhere, including prominent features in Time magazine, Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone and the Hollywood Reporter. Fox’s Laura Ingraham — who did a segment during the six-week period questioning whether Ocasio-Cortez would have to go to jail because of an aide’s alleged campaign finance violations — has invited her on her show and said she admired her political rise. // 📰: Associated Press", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/55ebba16d22370ef037773b2b0d1477b/5E5DD82D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/56666993_1311489689009001_6100947015035955272_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwVU_x5AlVK/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d25ccaa0e968a02c2ee82d806deb2d1f/5DC12425/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/55833139_997738133949235_7585157603031450016_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwVIV2QFabs/", "caption": "Yes! 👏 The Pulitzer Board announced that it was honoring Aretha Franklin with a posthumous award, commemorating the Queen of Soul in the category of “special citations.” At an announcement ceremony at Columbia University, Pulitzer Prize administrator Dana Canedy specifically highlighted Franklin “for her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades.” The Pulitzer Prize is yet another feather in Franklin’s cap.

I thank the Capitol Police, the FBI, the House Sergeant at Arms, and the Speaker of the House for their attention to these threats,” the congresswoman said in a statement.

It also said the congresswoman “receives daily death threats ― almost all of them threatening to kill her because of her religion.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday that she spoke with the House Sergeant at Arms about Omar’s safety and security.

In the speech, which O’Brien called “one of the nicest speeches I’ve heard in a long time,” Bradley talked about how the hit HBO series transcended the way he viewed himself. In paraphrasing the speech on “Conan,” Bradley recalled that he was “somebody who grew up overweight and kind of unhappy because of it,” and he believed that “life is going to pass you by because of it.” “All the time when you go to bed and you think, ‘I’d give anything to wake up and not have this weight,’” Bradley said of how he used to view himself.

He listed the hotels as: 1️⃣ The Dorchester, London, 2️⃣45 Park Lane, London, 3️⃣ Coworth Park, England, 4️⃣ The Beverly Hills Hotel, Beverly Hills, 5️⃣ Hotel Bel-Air, Los Angeles, 6️⃣ Le Meurice, Paris, 7️⃣ Hotel Plaza Athenee, Paris, 8️⃣ Hotel Eden, Rome, 9️⃣ Hotel Principe di Savoia, Milan “They’re nice hotels.

I’ve learned over years of dealing with murderous regimes that you can’t shame them. But you can shame the banks, the financiers and the institutions that do business with them and choose to look the other way,” he added.

Now, California lawmakers are considering cracking down on them in the name of waste and energy reduction. The bill from Assemblyman Phil Ting passed its first hurdle on Monday when the state Assembly’s Natural Resources Committee voted 6-3 to send the legislation to its next committee hearing. If it’s passed and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signs it, businesses would have until 2022 to switch to an electronic receipt system and provide paper receipts to customers upon request only. “Most of us don’t need a physical receipt for every transaction. It doesn’t make sense to kill so many trees and produce 12 billion pounds of carbon emissions, the equivalent of one million cars on the road, to make something we don’t often need,” Ting said in a statement when he introduced the bill earlier this year. Many receipts, his office noted, have become excessively long because of the “coupons, promotions and surveys” companies attach to them. Pharmacy chain CVS is perhaps most famous for this. The financial penalties Ting is proposing aren’t harsh, especially for a large company like CVS. Any business found in violation of the changed rules would be allotted two warnings before incurring a $25-per-day fine with a maximum annual fine of $300. Certain small businesses with gross annual receipts under $1 million and cash-only establishments would be exempt. The proposal to crack down on receipts, which often can’t be recycled because of additives to the paper, follows efforts across the state and elsewhere to ban plastic straws, another consumer freebie that’s difficult to recycle because of its small size. The bill has the support of many environmental groups but hasn’t gained traction with business leaders, who say it would be expensive for many businesses to switch to a point-of-sale system capable of handling electronic receipts. With Monday’s passage, Ting’s bill now heads to a vote by the Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee. // 📸: Getty Images ⁣\n⁣", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e71531b5b9fc5facde968645a8124003/5E4F6897/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/54731523_366016944127121_1398574795688563787_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvhNbAnJIpx/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/87fcc6142b52087615fadb1d2e678fd0/5DC1F633/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/53528535_2354120324600758_6427540677967166899_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvgyFkgDUXW/", "caption": "Wow! ⚡️ Nine nurses who work in the labor and delivery unit at the largest hospital in Maine are expecting babies in the next few months.

John Wayne played Genghis Khan. If John Wayne can play Genghis Khan, I can play Bess of Hardwick.” Asian-Americans are familiar with many Asian or Asian-inspired roles that have been given to white actors. Scarlett Johansson’s whitewashed Major in “Ghost in the Shell” and Emma Stone’s Allison Ng in “Aloha” stand out in recent memory. And throughout Hollywood history, roles that should have gone to Asians also went to white actors. In some cases, they even brought home awards for these depictions. Yul Brynner, who was mainly of Russian descent, portrayed the King of Siam in the 1956 musical “The King and I,” winning an Oscar for Best Actor. Luise Rainer won the Best Actress Academy Award in 1938 for her portrayal of O-Lan in “The Good Earth,” based on a book of the same name about a family of Chinese farmers. Chan explained that when it comes to representation, the stories of the past involving people of color still need to be highlighted. She spent a portion of last year working on a documentary about the Chinese Labour Corps, a group of some 95,000 Chinese farm laborers who were recruited from their villages to serve Britain during World War I. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/03382ab1052bfa95d329ab5fd5d6a146/5E507F42/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/53241347_429677821134099_8228407152324303052_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvXBO4bgbRY/", "caption": "This is giving us such life! 🥰 @janellemonae tweeted about the @queereye episode featuring Jess Guilbeaux, a 23-year-old lesbian living in Kansas who was disowned by her parents as a teen.

The elementary school student, better known as “Tani,” went undefeated at the championships, where he outsmarted opponents from top private schools with pricey chess tutors. “I want to be the youngest grandmaster,” Tani told the New York Times. Tani is well on his way to achieving that goal, as the third-grader has already established an unwavering dedication to improving his chess prowess. His mother, Oluwatoyin Adewumi, reportedly takes him to free three-hour practice sessions in Harlem every Saturday, while his father, Kayode, allows him to play chess online on his laptop each evening. “He is so driven,” his school chess teacher, Shawn Martinez told the New York Times. “He does 10 times more chess puzzles than the average kid. He just wants to be better.” Martinez estimates that the youngster could achieve the chess master title in one to two years. The youngest chess grandmaster to-date earned the prestigious title at the age of 12. “Tani IS ALL HEART!” wrote Russell Makofsky, the man who oversees the P.S. 116 chess club and who started a GoFundMe campaign to help support Tani and his family as he prepares for the elementary national championship in May. “Let’s all show our HEART and help Tani’s family secure a home where he can continue on his journey.” Since starting the GoFundMe page on March 15, the campaign has exceeded its goal of $50,000, raising over $103,400 (and counting).

The computer system must be rebooted using floppy disks that only the general manager — a solid member of Gen X — knows how to use. The dot-matrix printer broke, so employees write out membership cards by hand. And the store’s business transactions are backed up on a reel-to-reel tape that can’t be replaced because Radio Shack went out of business. Yet none of that has kept this humble franchise in an Oregon strip mall from thriving as the advent of on-demand movie streaming laid waste all around it. When a Blockbuster in Australia shuts its doors for the last time on March 31, the Bend store will be the only one left on Earth. “It’s pure stubbornness, for one. We didn’t want to give in,” said general manager Sandi Harding, who has worked at the franchise for 15 years and receives a lot of the credit for keeping it alive well past its expiration date. “We did everything we could to cut costs and keep ourselves relevant.” The store was once one of five Blockbusters owned by the same couple, Ken and Debbie Tisher, in three central Oregon towns. But by last year, the Bend franchise was the last local Blockbuster standing. A tight budget meant no money to update the surviving store. That’s paying off now with a nostalgia factor that stops first-time visitors of a certain age in their tracks: the popcorn ceilings, low fluorescent lighting, wire metal video racks and the ubiquitous yellow-and-blue ticket stub logo that was a cultural touchstone for a generation. “In a lot of towns, the Blockbuster was the only place that was open past nine o’clock, and a lot of them stayed open until midnight...” The Bend store had eight years under its belt as a local video store before it converted to a Blockbuster in 2000, a time when this high desert city was still a sleepy community with a small-town feel to match. // 📸 and 📰: @apnews ⁣⠀", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/81daca546dffff84a6d39b7d12ce2851/5E5BE336/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c177.0.725.725a/s640x640/54446633_438462493565110_2281738376791219533_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvKmgDSAiRu/", "caption": "Change is happening in New Zealand: “I strongly believe that the vast majority of gun owners in New Zealand will agree with the sentiment that change needs to occur.” –– New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.

State Rep. Dar’shun Kendrick (D) is calling the proposed legislation a “testicular bill of rights.” “You want some regulation of bodies and choice? Done!” Kendrick, who represents metro Atlanta’s 93rd District, tweeted. Her proposal brings into sharp focus conservatives’ crusade to legislate control of women’s bodies through restrictive abortion bills and other measures that undermine reproductive rights. In addition to the vasectomy and Viagra measures, the legislative package would make it an “aggravated assault” for a man to have sex without a condom. It would also dictate paternity testing before eight weeks of pregnancy and require expectant fathers to immediately begin paying child support. Last on Kendrick’s list is a proposed 24-hour waiting period for any man who wishes to purchase pornography or sex toys in Georgia. The aim of the proposed legislation is to “bring awareness to the fact that if you’re going to legislate our bodies, then we have every right to propose legislation to regulate yours,” Kendrick told Rolling Stone. The Georgia House last week approved a bill that which would criminalize most abortions after a doctor can detect a heartbeat in the womb. (That typically occurs around six weeks of gestation, before many women even realize they are pregnant.) The bill moves now to the state Senate, which, like the House, has a Republican majority. If it passes the Senate, it will go to Gov. Brian Kemp (R), who has said he supports the bill. ⁣", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0f6ddd0a6b528f003d57db695712f2af/5E61C5CB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/51794432_126868915108212_9057165873905955296_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvHD8Hxlp5o/", "caption": "YES! 🔥 Marvel is moving forward on “Shang-Chi,” the comic book superhero studio’s first movie featuring an Asian lead character, building on the success of “Captain Marvel” and “Black Panther” and the studio’s efforts to feature more diverse superhero characters.

She said the Instagram version of self-care and what it actually means to take care of yourself are two very different things. “Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with treating yourself, and it has an important place in the priorities I set for my own time and money. However, conflating self-care and ‘treating yourself’ is misguided and potentially harmful,” Bilek, 34, said. “When self-care becomes a competitive and performative ritual on social media, it defeats its purpose.” Bilek, who is also responsible for helping others come up with strategies to protect their mental health, personally chooses self-care in the form of enforcing healthy lifestyle habits. (And then breaking or adjusting as necessary.) “Good self-care is typically more difficult and less glamorous than treating yourself,” she said. “It means doing things like having good sleep hygiene, getting a little more exercise, staying hydrated, taking medication as prescribed, eating at regular intervals, creating healthy boundaries and taking a break from social media.” // #WhatWomenWantNow", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/609e88e8709986cadb91b205b570ee17/5E523E8B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/54731696_785399265168400_1812136983399238632_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvDIdKTl2PH/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/16e80f3de63857fd322d782e71598d20/5DC189F4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/53396438_363798757550805_5602109160719978292_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvC2WAEAPBb/", "caption": "Comedian and YouTube star Lilly Singh will take over outgoing NBC late-night host Carson Daly’s time slot, the network announced, making her the only female late-night host currently on a major broadcast network when her new show premieres in September.

McCartney also said an hour of mindfulness meditation and getting adequate sleep each night is critical for her. “I’ve never needed these skills more than I have currently with global morale seemingly hitting an all-time low,” she said. McCartney said she hopes women ― especially those with a public platform ― continue to discuss what self-care habits work for them as a way to normalize the subject.

On the whole, it is quite a different part of the brain: Law is very analytical, and acting is more instinctive and emotionally driven,” Chan, who’s also in “Captain Marvel,” told the outlet. “But, it does come in handy with learning lines ― and reading my own contract.” Chan said in the interview that while she enjoyed the “challenge” of earning her degree, she thinks she would’ve made a “pretty miserable lawyer.” She also said that while she’d been involved in drama and music since she was a kid, she didn’t view acting as a viable career until later on in life. She eventually auditioned for drama school in secret. Because of the lack of Asian representation on the big screen, she told The Los Angeles Times that her father questioned whether she’d be able to nab enough jobs. “[My] dad said to me, ‘It doesn’t matter how good you are or how talented you are — how many faces do you see on the screen that look like ours? You won’t get enough work,’” the actress told the outlet in August. “I said, ‘Dad, I just want to be part of a change.’\" After having been part of one of the most culturally impactful movies for Asian-Americans in recent memory, Chan told Modern Luxury she’s “grateful” for the experience. “I have never been part of a project where people had such personal reactions to it. People come up to me on the streets or at the airport just to say thank you,” she said. “I think it has to do with people feeling seen for the first time.

His mom explained, “Yes, two princesses can marry each other!” According to the couple, the boy’s mind seemed blown in the most delightful way. They, too, were moved by the brief-but-memorable encounter. “I nearly cried!” Emma said. “My wife was just over the moon.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) went viral again recently. ⚡️ This time it wasn’t because of her dancing skills or a Twitter clapback, but thanks to her sharp questioning of Michael Cohen at the House oversight committee hearing this week. 🙏 The freshman New York congresswoman “expertly laid a trap” to get President Donald Trump’s tax returns, and “won” the Cohen hearing, according to two raving press accounts. Ocasio-Cortez’s testimony focused primarily on Trump’s alleged deflation of his financial assets in order to lower his tax burden. First, she zeroed in on Trump Links, a golf course in Ocasio-Cortez’s district that was constructed with $127 million in city taxpayer funds. The city’s deal with Trump nonetheless stipulated that the Trump Organization could keep all of the profits it earned from the course for the first four years. “This doesn’t seem to be the only time the president has benefited at the expense of the public,” Ocasio-Cortez said, pivoting to the heart of the matter: Whether Trump deliberately deflated the value of Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, to lower his local property tax bill. “To your knowledge, was the president interested in lowering his local real estate tax bills?” she asked.“Yes,” Cohen responded. Ocasio-Cortez confirmed from Cohen that obtaining Trump’s federal and state tax returns would help ascertain the extent of his tax evasion efforts. And she also identified other individuals, such as Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg, who could testify about Trump’s practices prior to Cohen’s arrival in the organization. Notwithstanding her impressive performance, the secret to Ocasio-Cortez’s success was remarkably prosaic ― a team effort informed by the desire to uncover truth for the public’s benefit, according to staff. “If there was one person that wasn’t involved in this question preparation and committee preparation, it wouldn’t have been as successful as it was,” said Klarissa Reynoso, Ocasio-Cortez’s chief legislative correspondent who supervised the congresswoman’s preparation for the hearing. // 📸: Getty Images ⁣\n⁣", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d4a96cb151be27c691e89e84822b972c/5E511534/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/51890454_2397250743894925_5976906634163161408_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuecLTdlwEL/", "caption": "Ellen Page wrote an op-ed to remind the world that ― regardless of whether actor Jussie Smollett staged a racist and homophobic attack against himself ― hate violence against members of marginalized communities is very real. “We, as LGBTQ+ people, are forced to fear for our safety because instances of hate violence... happen. They happen to us all the time,” the actress and LGBTQ activist wrote in a guest column for The Hollywood Reporter. Page addressed allegations that Smollett, an actor on Fox’s “Empire,” orchestrated a fake attack last month in Chicago. Smollett told police that two masked men yelled racial and homophobic slurs, beat him up, tied a rope around his neck and poured bleach on him. After a monthlong investigation, Chicago police charged the actor with filing a false report and said he staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary.” “The conversation around Jussie Smollett has led us all to examine hate violence and its implications and aftermath. I had no reason to doubt Jussie,” Page continued, adding that through her recent work on her TV docuseries “Gaycation” she has met many survivors of hate crimes. “I know how prevalent and pernicious it can be,” she added. “If this situation was staged, it could make victims even more reluctant to report these crimes. Very real crimes.” Hate crimes, like the one Smollett said happened to him, are on the rise: The FBI reported last year that hate crimes increased 17 percent from the year before. “While the media and public debate the case and await more information, we must not lose sight of the very real, endemic violence that LGBTQ+ people, people of color and other underrepresented communities face every day,” Page wrote. People of color are disproportionately victimized by hate violence. In 2017, the country’s population was 13 percent black, while 28 percent of all hate crime victims were black. LGBTQ people, especially trans women of color, are at a greater risk as well. Twenty-nine transgender people were murdered in 2017, the deadliest year on record for the community. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c87df89479905d2bc795116582fcf8ec/5E59EEAF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/53165364_149321622753771_8851013706799911480_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bud1aUCA8tP/", "caption": "Yes! 👉 “Racism historically in this society sends a message that you are ‘less than,’” former President Obama said recently at an event in California. “We feel we have to compensate by exaggerating stereotypical ways men are supposed to act.

Earlier this month, the staff at Kennebec Valley Humane Society in Augusta, Maine, threw the canine couple a dog wedding in order to raise awareness among potential adopters that they are a bonded pair and need to be placed in a home together. Stevanie Roy, the director of operations at KVHS, told HuffPost that the doggie duo was found in a cemetery in Chelsea, Maine, in August 2018 with their leashes tied together. The staff at the shelter figured they were close, but their adorable behaviors toward each other quickly confirmed that their feelings ran much deeper than puppy love. Roy noted that the two “can be found snuggling together for hours,” but the cuteness doesn’t stop there. Roy explains that Jack, 10, is a pretty laid-back guy, “very treat motivated” and — most importantly — a true gentleman. “He sacrifices all toys and comfy beds for his lady, keeping chivalry alive,” Roy said. Diane, 7, seems to be the boss in the relationship and tends to decide “their adventures” together. But she also adores her beau. “She always gets super excited when getting reunited with Jack, and is always found doing a little dance when she sees him coming towards her,” Roy said. Since Jack and Diane have been at the facility for some time, the staff thought throwing a dog wedding would be a good way of getting the word out about them. Plus, Roy notes, “We have always called them our old married couple.” // 📸: SABRINA BEGGS // Story: Elyse Wanshel", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a720677ce2b723c1da59e66da3123975/5E58B91E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/52147153_313521396021334_5770347272244395650_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuJN9eCg_a2/", "caption": "Love this. 💜 \"Truthfully, if people have a problem with my relationship, it’s because most don’t know what love without ownership feels like. Our love challenges society’s views of the male and female roles. That is, it confronts the assumption that a man owns the copyright on his girlfriend’s sexuality. In the same way, people view sexy selfies as thirst traps or a sex-themed joke as an invitation. Maybe a girl just wants to express her whole humanity. My sexuality is as much a working part of my personality as my wit. It doesn’t lie dormant in an underwear drawer, waiting for my lover to get into the mood. I express it openly and profit off it because that feels natural to me. It doesn’t take away from the well of deep intimacy that my partner and I share. The sexuality I sell is surface-level, not the shared trust of two people in love, walking hand-in-hand through hardship. We need to let go of the scarlet letter burned into sex workers that cuts us off from society and the embrace of our partners’ friends and families, let alone those potential partners. It’s killing us, between the stigma and the resulting violence against sex workers.

It’s no surprise she sees her highly anticipated “Captain Marvel” role as an opportunity to highlight diversity and inclusion both in front of and behind the camera. “I want to go out of my way to connect the dots,” she continued. “It just took me using the power that I’ve been given now as Captain Marvel,” Larson added. ”[The role] comes with all these privileges and powers that make me feel uncomfortable because I don’t really need them. … But any uncomfortableness I feel is balanced by the knowledge that it gives me the ability �to advocate for myself and others.” // 📸: Disney & Marvel", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1a66cc6704a8f4834be659c4d5303bc5/5E45FD73/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/49906726_2268884536709886_7028049203998207288_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt-9oV_A3Z8/", "caption": "Because of Eunique Jones Gibson (@euniquejg), black kids can dream, imagine, and aspire to be whatever they want to be.

Jessica Jewett is a Georgia-based author and artist who was born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and uses a wheelchair. When she learned this week through Instagram that the iconic doll brand is expanding and diversifying its offerings to include a Barbie with a prosthetic limb and a Barbie who uses a wheelchair, she had an emotional reaction. “It just took me back to being 5, 6, 7 years old, asking my mom and grandma why there aren’t dolls that look like me,” she told HuffPost. “I used to ask all the time why Barbie’s parent company Mattel couldn’t make a wheelchair for the doll.” It’s a long time coming for Jewett, who wrote on Twitter Tuesday that this was the toy she “needed as a little girl.” Growing up in the ’80s, she has no memory of seeing herself represented in dolls and toys like her friends did. “I would just start making up my own thing instead, which is probably why I became a writer,” she said. “I ended up having to make up my own stories that had nothing to do with me, because there was nothing like me out there.” That lack of representation and accessibility followed Jewett into other aspects of her life, as well. At her elementary school, the special education classrooms were in a back room, where she said the teachers were more like babysitters than actual teachers. “I used to sort of have this feeling from a really young age that I was different, but not understanding why that difference was something to be hidden,” she said.

The 14th-century nun apparently faked her own death by creating a dummy “in the likeness of her body” before running away from her convent, according to archivists at the University of York. But her escape was discovered. “She now wanders at large to the notorious peril to her soul and to the scandal of all of her order,” Archbishop of York William Melton wrote (in Latin) about Joan in a record book dated 1318, the Guardian reports. Archivists at the University of York resurfaced details about Joan’s story last week, while translating and digitizing 16 registers in which the archbishops of York documented their business between 1304 and 1405. Joan was apparently so fed up with her life at St. Clement’s Nunnery in York that she concocted a wild plan to escape from her vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. According to a marginal note in the register, Joan simulated “a bodily illness” and “pretended to be dead.” With the help of some accomplices, she tricked her fellow Benedictine sisters into burying a lookalike dummy “in a sacred space” among actual deceased members of her order. Joan fled about 30 miles away, to the town of Beverley, according to the Church Times. When rumors about her scandalous escapade finally reached Melton, the horrified archbishop ordered a church official in Beverley to send her back to the convent. Melton’s note in the register describes how Joan had “impudently cast aside the propriety of religion and the modesty of her sex” and faked her death “in a cunning, nefarious manner.” “Having turned her back on decency and the good of religion, seduced by indecency, she involved herself irreverently and perverted her path of life arrogantly to the way of carnal lust and away from poverty and obedience,” Melton wrote. University of York historian Sarah Rees Jones, who is leading the digitizing project, told HuffPost that her team isn’t sure if Joan ever returned to the convent ― either willingly or by force. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d1dc875ede53a738cccccf1c4bdb0f41/5E3EF30C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/51337192_120489035681582_1065730989475303636_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt8ru94js0g/", "caption": "Yes, Mandy Moore! 👏 // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/52fdfc8fa0c1f73e70d9cdea899f072e/5E59AF55/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/51668781_154446672102587_4673824835552514613_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt8LG-djNnl/", "caption": "Glory Edim (@guidetoglo) began building her empire of knowledge at an early age.

Late Wednesday, lawmakers reached a budget deal that, if approved, would prevent another government shutdown at the end of the week and fund the federal government through September.  The legislative package does not include the more than $5 billion that President Donald Trump has long demanded to pay for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump’s insistence led to a standoff with lawmakers late last year and the longest-ever government shutdown in U.S. history. However, the new deal does include increased funding for ICE and Customs and Border Protection, according to the Democratic representatives’ joint statement. “In this country, our diversity is our greatest strength. Immigrants fuel our nation’s economy, enrich our nation’s culture, and enhance our social fabric,” they said in their statement. “And yet, this Administration continues to threaten the dignity and humanity of our immigrant population,” the congresswomen said, condemning the Trump administration’s separation of thousands of migrant children from their parents at the border and its efforts to restrict entry of asylum-seekers. “The Department of Homeland Security does not deserve an increase in funding [emphasis in original], and that is why we intend to vote no on this funding package.” The lawmakers went on to name the “abusive agencies” that would be receive more money under the bill, including CBP receiving nearly $950 million above current funding levels and ICE getting an increase of more than $500 million.

The show’s idea of education isn’t limited to just letters and numbers: It means empathy, kindness, resilience and the other social and emotional skills kids need to thrive. To celebrate the milestone, “Sesame Street” and the nonprofit behind it, Sesame Workshop, are hosting a yearlong celebration filled with celebrity cameos, social media campaigns and even a nationwide road trip. Over the last five decades, the Peabody Award-winning show has tried to put kids first with its purposeful writing and direction that tackle tough topics in the life of a child.There was the “Sesame Street” special in 1983 when the show grappled with addressing the sudden death of Will Lee, the actor who portrayed the neighborhood’s beloved Mr. Hooper. The Sesame Workshop team met with child psychologists, religious leaders and other experts to create a special so the show’s little viewers could say goodbye to Mr. Hooper. In it, the other characters had to teach Big Bird that his friend wasn’t coming back, but that he’d still have his memories of him. “And we can remember him, and remember him, and remember him as much as we want to,” Big Bird said in the episode. The special aired on Thanksgiving, when Sesame Workshop knew many parents and caretakers would be home to talk with their kids about the episode. That same decade, the show changed one of its characters’ plots amid a growing cultural awareness of the problem of child sex abuse. Originally, Mr. Snuffleupagus was a character who would enter and exit the scene before anyone but Big Bird could see him. That meant other characters didn’t believe Big Bird when he’d tell them about his friend. Not wanting to discourage kids from coming forward for fear of being doubted, the show decided to introduce Mr. Snuffleupagus to everyone else, and Big Bird’s friends assured him they would believe him from then on. // 📸: Sesame Workshop", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/598b3711fbba2a90cd7ad7faa3153862/5E4F5EA0/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/51397602_584811118659927_1788285004308852111_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt0qepMFrCL/", "caption": "Carmelo Anthony (@carmeloanthony) will go down in the Hall of Fame.

In 2016, he made a single Instagram post urging his fellow athletes to use their platforms to stand up against injustice and a domino effect could be seen through the world of sports as other athletes raised their voices. Following in the footsteps of Muhammad Ali and Tommie Davis, Anthony won’t let anyone silence him. For HuffPost Black Voices’ “We Built This” series, Anthony spoke to us about his future in basketball, his advocacy work and how his Afro-Latinx roots empower him. // Interview by: @_tarynitup // #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistoryBuiltThis", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/705d6035bee9376ab43c31ef26d353c5/5E5A03AD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.133.1080.1080a/s640x640/50900075_385995198614885_6253394827835281756_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtzKVSLl-gS/", "caption": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) took a dig at Trump’s reading skills after the president criticized, with falsehoods, the Green New Deal during his campaign rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night. Trump likened the deal — a sweeping House resolution introduced last week by Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) — to a “high school term paper that got a low mark.” He added that the resolution, which is aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions and guaranteeing jobs and high-quality health care for all Americans, would result in the shutdown of “American energy” as well as a “little thing called air travel.” “They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home and put millions of Americans out of work,” Trump said of the Democrats’ plan. Earlier in his speech, he’d suggested the deal would mean “you’re not allowed to own cows anymore.” Ocasio-Cortez reacted to Trump’s remarks with a fiery tweet. “Ah yes, a man who can’t even read briefings written in full sentences is providing literary criticism of a House Resolution,” the freshman congresswoman wrote, adding a reference to a 2018 Washington Post article about Trump’s habit of receiving oral intelligence briefings instead of reading them. Several of Trump’s assertions about the Green New Deal are false. For one thing, getting rid of planes, cars and cows are not part of the Democrats’ plan. The resolution also does not explicitly call for the end of fossil fuel development, though it does push for “meeting 100 percent of the power demand” with solar and wind energy over the next decade. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a71f95f9e93d780d92e71d2c8e6bbb57/5E4BA319/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.81.1080.1080a/s640x640/51119604_245632896368468_1409620172696336523_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Btyu-k4h5yN/", "caption": "CNN’s Don Lemon was momentarily at a loss for words after watching an interview in which embattled Virginia Gov.

Some of the most heartwarming shots show Adrian being embraced by his mother and 17-year-old brother, Lucas. “When your child comes out as trans, the best thing to do is create a photoshoot to celebrate the fact that he silently and bravely stepped out of the race that he never wanted to be in, found his own lane and proceeded to win,” she wrote in a Jan. 29 Facebook post.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) had some fighting words for President Trump after he seemingly took a swipe at her and her fellow progressives who describe themselves as democratic socialists. “We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,” Trump said in his State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, drawing boos and chants of “USA” from GOP lawmakers in the House chamber. Democrats in attendance had a more varied response, however. Ocasio-Cortez, the newly elected millennial progressive from New York, flashed a big smile but remained seated. Fellow democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sat stone-faced. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) also remained seated behind Trump but clapped politely. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), meanwhile, stood up and clapped along with several of his fellow Senate Democrats. Asked later about the president’s dig at socialism, which he tied to the recent unrest in Venezuela, Ocasio-Cortez told reporters that she had touched a nerve. “I think it was great. I think he’s scared. ... He sees that everything is closing in on him. And he knows he’s losing the battle of public opinion when it comes to the actual substantive proposals that we’re advancing to the public,” she said, citing polls that showed a majority of the public in support of her proposal to dramatically increase the top marginal income tax rate to 70 percent. The congresswoman further said that Trump had no “substantive proposals to counter” her ideas and that he further “has no vision” for America. “Everything is about what he doesn’t want. Everything is about the boogeyman,” she added. Ocasio-Cortez has been drawing heat from the right and self-styled centrist Howard Schultz, the billionaire former Starbucks CEO who is considering an independent run for president, for her idea that those making over $10 million should pay a marginal tax rate of 70 percent to fund climate change initiatives. Her remark questioning whether “a system that allows billionaires to exist” is immoral has also attracted criticism from conservatives. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/164a46645f8737ad903f463e810e790b/5E50977B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/50651983_120116952384642_8773129732984351472_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bti9j_wA5h4/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/27825807b336b6b84f52bc3bbcb35322/5DC13555/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/50867372_144132249934940_4459041867170822431_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bti2ERPggCn/", "caption": "The clap heard round the world. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a699e0db08dc141e413bcd60890adfc3/5E5F4A07/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/50962695_474514799746359_4217770838847378654_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bths4dujSPI/", "caption": "Former Georgia state representative and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams highlighted the importance of unity in the Democratic party response to Trump's #SOTU. 🙌 #StaceyAbrams #StateOfTheUnion", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/753b0d030ce3eddb98be12c0f2e8d057/5E4CB0DE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/50947276_203067353987032_5922642306673420701_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtheQOLlsj0/", "caption": "Before Trump’s State of the Union address, Sen.

I was just smoking, just smoking my nerves away and wasn’t nourishing myself,” she added, miming smoking a cigarette with her hands. “And cut to 10 years later, I just figured out how to say thank you to life by trying to nourish myself, by taking care of myself, by not apologizing for occupying space ― which is not something I knew how to do 10 years ago,” she said.

The institution, founded by the Chile-based Selenna Foundation that protects their rights, is a milestone in a country that was so socially conservative that it only legalized divorce in 2004. In recent years, the families of trans children have demanded greater acceptance — a call that recently led to the approval of a law that allows people over the age of 14 to change their name and gender in official records with the consent of their parents or legal guardians. Activists and parents of transgender children say that’s the stage of childhood or pre-adolescence when children discover that their gender does not correspond to their body.A 2016 report by UNESCO said that in Latin America, as in the rest of the world, violence against sexual orientation or gender identity in schools wreaks “havoc on the development of the affected people, school coexistence, academic performance and, consequently, their permanence in school.” Chile has slowly shifted its conservative stands on social issues. In 2012, it passed an anti-discrimination law and in 2017, it ended its absolute ban on abortion, legalizing it in when a woman’s life is in danger, a fetus is not viable and in cases of rape. The shift has been accelerated by a clerical sex abuse scandal.

The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.” Smollett also addressed the skepticism about the attack, telling Essence that he has been “100 percent factual and consistent on every level” with authorities. “Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served,” he said. Chicago Police reported on Tuesday that the “Empire” actor was attacked by two unidentified masked men in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Smollett was reportedly walking to get food around 2 a.m. when the two attackers approached him and began “yelling out racial and homophobic slurs,” according to police. Smollett told police that the two men beat him up, “poured an unknown chemical substance,” believed to be bleach, on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck. In a follow-up interview with police, Smollett said the men yelled “MAGA country” during the attack, an apparent reference to President Donald Trump’s slogan “Make American Great Again.” Smollett, a gay black man, was admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital after the assault, but was in “good condition” according to police reports. The “Empire” actor said he will address the specifics of the “horrific incident” soon, but he needed time to process the experience. “As my family stated, these types of cowardly attacks are happening to my sisters, brothers and non-gender-conforming siblings daily. I am not and should not be looked upon as an isolated incident,” Smollett said. “We will talk soon and I will address all details of this horrific incident, but I need a moment to process,” he concluded. “Most importantly, during times of trauma, grief and pain, there is still a responsibility to lead with love.

Walker.” Much like C.J. Walker, the black self-made millionaire that Spencer plays in the upcoming series, Spencer’s talent has brought her critical acclaim, with roles in blockbusters including “Green Book,” “﻿The Shape of Water,” “Hidden Figures” and “The Help.” To this day, however, the actress says she still needs help from allies to get her a paycheck at least equal to her male co-stars. “I have to say, when I was negotiating my deal for ‘Madam C.J.,’ LeBron James had to intervene,” Spencer said Saturday, according to IndieWire. “So we need all our male counterparts to be in the fight with us.” This time last year, Spencer detailed a similar situation in which a famous colleague had to step in to help her get equal pay. According to Spencer, actress Jessica Chastain negotiated for higher pay and insisted that Spencer be paid the same as her for a holiday comedy in which they were set to co-star. Spencer and Chastain had previously starred together in “The Help,” for which Spencer received the supporting actress Oscar. “She’s walking the walk and she’s actually talking the talk,” Spencer said during a women’s panel at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. “She said, ‘Octavia, we’re going to get you paid on this film. .... You and I are going to be tied together. We’re going to be favored nations, and we’re going to make the same thing.’ ...

Shepard revealed that it was actually him — not Bell — who wasn’t sold on the relationship right off the bat. “So I never, ever was like, ‘Oh, I hope I can “keep” Kristen.’ I was going, ‘Do I want to be with a Christian, who has eight people living in her house for free, who has to get out of the car when there’s a dog that doesn’t have a leash and ruin her whole day to rescue this dog?’” the “Parenthood” actor said. “That’s great. And she’s good. But that’s not what I want to do,” Shepard said. ” I’m not that good. I don’t want to spend my day finding the owner of a dog. So I wasn’t fearful I would lose her. I wasn’t certain I wanted to be with someone like that.” Over time, Shepard said he observed Bell’s loving and generous spirit and took note of the “undeniable” results of living that way. “There’s something charmed about it. And I think it’s charmed because it starts with her being just endlessly generous and loving and giving people the benefit of the doubt and believing in people and believing the world’s a wonderful place and all these things,” he said. “And then down river, it proves to be all those things to her. And me, on the other hand, is like, ‘No one’s going to take my wallet.’ That’s all I’m thinking about. And I miss all this other stuff.” Shepard said that Bell, his wife of five years, never tried to convince him to be more like her; he just saw how rich her life was and wanted the same for himself.

When it comes to Kamala Harris, the answer to both questions appears to be yes. Harris, the Democratic senator from California who is now running for president, said during a CNN forum Monday evening that she believes health care should be a right ― and that creating a single, government-run insurance program modeled on Medicare is the best way to achieve that. Harris’ endorsement of Medicare for All is not a new development. She is among more than a dozen Democratic senators who in, in late 2017, co-sponsored Medicare for All legislation from Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont and longtime champion of the idea. Harris reiterated that support just a few weeks ago, in an op-ed for The New York Times. But the Medicare for All Act of 2017, as the legislation is formally called, envisions some dramatic changes to the U.S. health care system ― including a prohibition on private insurance, except for coverage of services outside the scope of the new government plan. The new plan would pay for just about every medically necessary service, so that wouldn’t leave much of a role, if any, for private coverage. So far, it hasn’t been clear whether all of the bill’s co-sponsors, several of whom are running for president or at least thinking about it, really want to see such a wholesale change happen ― or whether their support of the Sanders proposal was simply a way of signaling support for universal health care, which can take many forms and which can include a prominent role for private insurers. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/27459160a46f8854fabfbf75143b6282/5E50E663/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/49991705_611516922614055_3864204549369989385_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtQmJrplC9o/", "caption": "Latoya Shauntay Snell (@iamlshauntay) is running 10 marathons this year and she still gets fat-shamed. 😤 Here’s her story → \"Last year, I completed two 50Ks and four marathons ― three of which were done within a two-month span.

Perhaps this person thought I would and should feel comforted by the condolences that she (and her sizable following) offered about my “weight loss journey,” but I didn’t. Even worse, when I tried to have a private conversation with this person, she immediately blocked me... Over the years, I’ve encountered so many people who are absolutely mind-boggled when they learn I work out or participate in a multitude of events for reasons besides weight loss. And the disapproving commentary doesn’t just happen online ― I’ve experienced it offline, too. It’s only been a bit over a year since I was fat-shamed at the 2017 New York City Marathon. But the abuse began long before that. When I first started working out in May 2013, I weighed over 265 pounds and had a number of issues ― some of which had nothing to do with my weight ― that limited my mobility and left me in an immense amount of pain.

Every single one.” Rape kits are the primary tool used in sexual assault cases to collect physical evidence left on a survivor’s body. When that evidence is tested for DNA, it may be used to prosecute a perpetrator. But a rape kit is essentially useless if the evidence is not tested for DNA. It’s estimated that hundreds of thousands of kits sit untested in law enforcement facilities across the U.S. due to a lack of funding and other resources. The rape kit backlog has made national news in the last decade and many states have begun reporting their inventories of untested kits. According to End The Backlog, a program created by the nonprofit Joyful Heart Foundation, at least 225,000 untested rape kits has been discovered in that time. The three states with the highest numbers of reported untested rape kits are Florida (13,435), California (13,615) and North Carolina (15,160). “To me, the backlog is one of the clearest and most shocking demonstrations of how we regard these crimes in our society,” actress Mariska Hargitay said in a 2018 HBO documentary about the rape kit backlog titled “I Am Evidence.” // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dfd222ab53ff1d3b35c4f947ff2809f3/5E62B530/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/50504168_169207140713544_1335035312599175620_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtN97G_jrKa/", "caption": "Today is Queen Oprah's birthday. 👑🎂 Happy birthday! 💜 // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1526180d4445c5118f1d2ebba73c3cfb/5E45D535/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/50494190_240490060219956_6798396647394782101_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtMRrvbAtib/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fb70366122abe9f992870c07eb5e91f1/5DC18BBD/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/50601834_2153717344766663_4444504146047423945_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BtL5VM0ntHb/", "caption": "Yes. ✊🏾 The \"Black Panther\" cast picked up the top trophy at the 25th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

In the interview, she spoke about how her body changed after having kids and why it’s important for her to share her experience as a mom online ― including the time she posted a photo that showed her in postpartum mesh underwear. “Every morning when I look at myself in the mirror, I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, how did it get here?

One lesson she has learned over the past 13 months is that annoying baby toys are an unavoidable beast when you’ve got a little one in the house. “I tried to do that thing at the beginning where I only got her these, like, hipster wooden toys that are beautiful to the eye and don’t make your house look like it’s been overrun by children,” the “Mindy Project” creator said. “And she hates them, so I’ve had to give them all away. She only likes primary color, loud, beeping toys that are impossible to turn off.” But beyond the loud, beeping objects, Kaling said, she’s proud that many of her daughter’s favorite playthings are books. “She loves reading them — or pretending to read them. She loves eating them.

Close, for the record, has never felt as “free and as creative” as she does in this stage of her life and is pushing back against the notion that getting older means letting go of one’s sexuality. “It’s one of the great myths that you lose your sexuality as you get older,” Close remarked in an interview with The Guardian published on Monday. “I feel as free and as creative, as sexual and as eager, as I ever have. And it’s ironic because I’m thinking: ‘How much time do I have left now?’” she continued. “There are so many things I’m interested in doing. It’s one of those ironies, I suppose, that we sometimes start feeling comfortable in our own skin only late in our lives, but hopefully with enough time to benefit from it.” Close, who became a household name thanks to the blockbuster erotic thriller “Fatal Attraction,” explained that when it came time to shoot the sex scene with co-star Jonathan Pryce, both of the veteran performers dove right in. “We arrived on set in our jammies,” she told the outlet. “We were both thinking the same thing: ‘We’re pros, we’ve been doing this a long time. Let’s just get down to it.’” Close is by all accounts single, having split from her third husband, David Evans Shaw, in August 2015. Reacting to the news of her Oscar nomination, Close revealed that she was asleep when the nominations were announced and had turned off her phone. “It really does feel different,” she told “Today” about the nod. “I’m thrilled to be in this time in my life and this time in my career, to be invited into this incredibly special room.

The Netflix film has since earned 10 Oscar nominations and launched Aparicio into international stardom, with her recently making waves on the cover of Vogue México. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/36ecaff582372a77a3bbb3c0ee9244a3/5E5E2971/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/50008867_780288065687868_3799067379748262184_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs_ZzM8FZ0p/", "caption": "QUACK.

Hamill’s initial tweet included a clip of the video where many scantily clad women are twerking. “In the era of #MeToo how exactly does this empower women?” asked Hamill, before imploring leftists and Cardi B to chime in. Considering Cardi’s recent response to conservative commentator Tomi Lahren wherein she told Lahren that she would “dog walk” her if she didn’t leave Cardi alone, it’s not surprising that the rapper answered Hamill’s call. The 26-year-old told Hamill that the video was about women having agency over their bodies and asked if Hamill personally thinks that twerking half-naked means she deserves to get “raped and molested.” Hamill responded by saying that she agrees that “no means no, no matter what” but that she believes the video sexually objectifies women, and that “hurts all women & the cause.” “We’re not sex objects!” said Hamill, who also added that perhaps she’s just a hater because she can’t twerk.

A GoFundMe campaign started by MaryAnn Rolle, 55, amassed more than $169,000 in just over a week after the debut of a pair of Hulu and Netflix documentaries on the doomed festival and its dubious co-founders, Billy McFarland and Ja Rule. Rolle surpassed her original goal of raising $123,000 to recoup her losses from the event. Many of the donations were less than $20. She told The New York Times that McFarland owed her $134,000 for making and serving meals to staff preparing for the festival. In her GoFundMe page, Rolle said her credit took a hit. Rolle emerged as one of the most memorable figures in Netflix’s “Fyre,” which premiered Friday. In an emotional interview with filmmakers, Rolle said she still had difficulty talking about her experience working for the festival.\n“I don’t even like to talk about the Fyre Festival,” Rolle said. “Just take it away and just let me start a new beginning. Because they really, really, really hurt me.” She added: “I just leave it alone because it really pains me when I have to talk about it, so I just wipe it away.” On Sunday, Rolle posted a thank you note on her Facebook page for the people who supported her GoFundMe campaign. She told the Times that she appeared in Netflix’s documentary to shed light on what the scam did to her community. “People have responded well,” she told the paper. “What a wonderful world we live in where people are so generous.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/caee56c89c36526085a17af094a004c4/5E5B08E5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/50088389_228775334740633_1470025719840446767_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs9aQjIgbo0/", "caption": "Rep.

Proceeds benefit The Trevor Project, which works specifically to prevent suicide by LGBTQ youth, and AIDS United, which is dedicated to stopping AIDS in the U.S. \nAn alumnus of Immanuel Christian voiced support for the donation in the group’s statement, saying that he is “a living example that intolerance, both in policy and rhetoric, are harmful to the mental wellness and development of LGBTQ students, who are desperately looking for ways to fit in.” // 📸: Amazon/Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b43e3da608968c17662996a390e4401d/5E5B3BD2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/49325810_682569425471104_1827421407745422362_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsxq44wgDuH/", "caption": "Rep.

For instance, all 93 puppies paw-ticipating in the event, ranging in age from 13 to 26 weeks old, are rescues from 51 shelters in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, as well as from Costa Rica. The fetching lineup includes a shar-pei, Labrador retriever, St. Bernard, a very sleepy corgi and various mixed breeds.⠀\nThree disabled pups will also be competing — or adorably tackling other pups while chasing squeaky toys. They include Bumble, a hard-of-hearing and blind Australian shepherd mix, Will, a three-legged doodle mix, and Pippi, a blind Jack Russell mix. All the furballs you’ll see on TV were adopted last fall, when the special was taped.

Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday proposed what would be the most generous paid parental leave policy in the nation: six months of partially paid leave so parents or other family members can care for a newborn or newly adopted baby. Right now, some California parents have access to a combined four months of leave at partial pay. Those who get less include adoptive parents, same-sex couples and single parents. Two-thirds of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guarantee six months of paid time off to new mothers. Newsom’s plan doesn’t go that far. Instead, the proposal, unveiled as part of his 2019 budget, would allow two caretakers to split six months off, according to a fact sheet provided by his office. One parent could take three months, and the other parent or partner or another family member could take three more months, or vice versa. The policy would roll out slowly. At a press conference unveiling the state’s $209 billion budget on Thursday, Newsom said that leave would be paid for mainly with existing funds. “It’s a developmental necessity,” Newsom said of paid leave. “We’re committed to this.” Newsom’s proposal counts as groundbreaking and radical for the U.S., the only developed country in the world that doesn’t guarantee paid time off to new mothers; just two of 34 OECD countries do not guarantee paid leave to new fathers.

In a statement released Tuesday, the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents the workers, warned that safety could take a big hit in transit hubs as the federal government shutdown drags into week three, leaving staff without pay.\n“Every day I’m getting calls from my members about their extreme financial hardships and need for a paycheck,” said Hydrick Thomas, the organization’s TSA Council president. “Some of them have already quit and many are considering quitting the federal workforce because of this shutdown. The loss of officers, while we’re already shorthanded, will create a massive security risk for American travelers since we don’t have enough trainees in the pipeline or the ability to process new hires.” Last week, AFGE launched a lawsuit against the federal government for forcing federal employees to show up to work uncompensated, calling the demands “inhumane.” Around that time, the union said TSA agents were starting to skip work. The situation now appearing to be escalating. In addition to raising security issues, fewer staffers on duty would increase wait times with longer lines at airports. “It is completely unacceptable that the women and men who risk their lives safeguarding our airports are still required to report for work without knowing when they’ll be paid again,” AFGE National President J. David Cox Sr. said. Cox argued that compared with other agencies, the workers are facing tougher conditions and lackluster wages, making the shutdown especially grueling. “TSA Officers already have the least amount of rights of any federal officer, some of the lowest pay and highest attrition rates in government, and among the lowest morale of any federal agency. Working for weeks on end without being compensated ― while already being short-staffed ― only makes their situation worse,” he said. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b78abc75031e1b573ab756e2e8aba1d4/5E6310A6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.81.1080.1080a/s640x640/47694317_281116669182856_6403804138096713613_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bsa-T_JFjnh/", "caption": "Wow 👉 President Trump is doubling down on his demand for border wall funding, but every member of the House of Representatives whose district lies along the proposed barrier refuses to back the idea.

Just days after the hotly debated Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show paraded its historically narrow-minded ideals of beauty down the runway for yet another year, seven women stripped down to their underwear to show the brand ― and the world ― what true diversity looks like. They staged their protest outside a Victoria’s Secret store in London’s bustling Oxford Circus. The idea was conceptualized by Joanne Morales and Sylvia Mac. Morales is the founder of Nunude, a U.K.-based lingerie, clothing and swimwear brand that boasts a wide range of nude garments to accommodate different skin tones and sizes. Mac is a child burn survivor who created her website Love Disfigure when she felt people with scars and skin conditions were not being properly represented in mainstream media and pop culture, and as a way to embrace her own body and inspire others to follow suit. Mac and Morales called on their communities of followers and customers to participate in what they agreed was not an angry protest but rather a way to celebrate diversity. Their shared mission was to provide an example of what it’s like be size inclusive but to also be inclusive of race, ability and both visible and invisible illness. “We were fed up seeing these so-called perfect body images online, with there being just one perceived beautiful body type,” Mac told HuffPost. // 📸: @j_theprophecy // 📰: @realgirlproject", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6f119301f25bcdaba40938912ad61edb/5E549FFB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.24.1080.1080a/s640x640/47692936_544195526054330_6954679621060525922_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BrgQJdzFGjU/", "caption": "Dog reveals > gender reveals. 🐶 💜 These adorable puppy photo shoots give standard gender reveal pics a run for their money. 👏 // 📸: Lindsay Wise, @rustandbonesokc, @@kinandkid and @wildfirecrowns_photography ⠀", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f7191586bed51e697bd5450af25776a6/5E3F47CB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/47584107_272650176934901_8444102607168669851_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Brf0TMeACzR/", "caption": "An 8-year-old Maryland girl reportedly received some high-powered encouragement after she lost a school election for class president by one vote.

The donor’s birth parents must both be of 100 percent Pakistani, Indian or Iranian descent. The donor’s blood type must be either “O” or “A.” And crucially, their red blood cells must be missing a common antigen called “Indian B.” Less than 4 percent of people with Pakistani, Indian or Iranian heritage are missing the Indian B antigen, according to OneBlood. // 📸: COURTESY OF ONEBLOOD", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fe296924d389f8be59d34516f742d845/5E4E8880/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/46590617_358906131353975_6530807983696275028_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BrKvK6-gB_b/", "caption": "Monica Lewinsky recently spoke out about success and growth. 🙌 // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8c5954c8f47abac0913149f25cbd76eb/5E4047CE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/46558417_345910219531079_6791133700516541074_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BrIK6V0g1qP/", "caption": "This is important. 👉 The world’s immigrant population doesn’t pose any notable risk to public health and, in fact, contributes to many of the health services in countries they migrate to, despite dire claims by right-leaning politicians and a rise in xenophobia, according to a study released Wednesday. The report, the result of a two-year commission by University College London and the Lancet, a medical journal, targets an uptick in anti-immigration policies around the world in recent years, notably under the administration of President Donald Trump and surrounding Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. A cohort of 20 experts analyzed nearly 100 studies and found about 1 billion people were moving or had moved in 2018, about a quarter of which crossed international boundaries. The number of refugees and people fleeing violence or natural disasters has skyrocketed this year, and the topic has become a political hot point through Europe and the United States. But these immigrant populations are beneficial to rich nations, the authors found, often traveling for an education or working in roles that contribute to local economies.

Tigar issued a temporary restraining order after hearing arguments in San Francisco. The request was made by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights, which quickly sued after President Donald Trump issued the ban this month in response to the caravans of migrants that have started to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump issued a proclamation on Nov. 9 that said anyone who crossed the southern border would be ineligible for asylum. The regulations, which will remain in place for three months absent a court order, could potentially make it harder for thousands of people who enter the U.S. to avoid deportation. “Individuals are entitled to asylum if they cross between ports of entry,” said Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “It couldn’t be clearer.” In recent years, tens of thousands of immigrants each year have shown up in the Arizona desert or on the north bank of the Rio Grande in Texas, surrendered to immigration agents and requested asylum. The Department of Homeland Security estimates around 70,000 people a year claim asylum between official ports of entry.\n\nTrump has argued that the recent caravans are a threat to national security.\n\nAround 3,000 people from the first of the caravans have arrived in Tijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, California. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Monday that it closed off northbound traffic for several hours at the San Ysidro crossing. It has also installed movable, wire-topped barriers, apparently to stop a potential mass rush of people.\n\nAs of Monday, 107 people detained between official crossings have sought asylum since Trump’s order went into effect, according to DHS, which oversees Customs and Border Protection.

The result was a “kitten hour” instead of a cocktail hour — where guests could play and snuggle with six kittens from the Seattle Animal Shelter. “There were volunteers there to make sure that the kittens weren’t overhandled and to keep them corralled in their pack-n-play,” Colleen said. “The kittens only stayed for about an hour, and judging by the way they wanted to fall asleep in our arms, they felt pretty relaxed. We thought that kittens would be a nice way to honor the love they’ve brought into our lives, while also not cheating on our cats by petting adult cats.” The couple also honored their cats at their reception — at a venue that did allow alcohol. 🍹🍹 “We did have cocktails named after our cats at the reception!” Iz said. // 📸 @fuckyeahweddings⠀", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b72ce5d6ac7c9cf4e290219c94348323/5E4F9D5F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/44757613_2041179032572080_101594155965407573_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BqYevXtFWXp/", "caption": "Minnesota Representative-elect Ilhan Omar said she was ready to challenge a 181-year-old ban on headwear on the floor of the House of Representatives.

Here's the the whole story. → In 1974, Jocelyn Bell Burnell’s male PhD supervisor at the University of Cambridge won a Nobel Prize for a discovery that she was the first to notice. Recently, the 75-year-old acclaimed astrophysicist won a coveted science prize of her own ― the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics. But instead of keeping the hefty $3 million award that comes with this distinction, Bell Burnell says she will be using it to help women, refugees, and other minority students follow in her footsteps and become physics researchers themselves. She will be donating her prize money to the Institute of Physics to create scholarships for people from underrepresented groups, the Institute said in a statement. Bell Burnell, a Quaker whose religion teaches simple living, claims she doesn’t need to have an extravagant lifestyle. “I don’t want or need the money myself and it seemed to me that this was perhaps the best use I could put to it,” Bell Burnell told the BBC. The award honors Bell Burnell for her discovery of pulsars ― neutron stars that emit electromagnetic radiation from their poles. These rapidly spinning radiation beams sweep past the Earth at regular intervals. The award also recognizes her “inspiring scientific leadership over the last five decades” according to a press release. Bell Burnell first noticed pulsars during a routine data collection in 1967, with the help of a radio telescope she was in charge of monitoring at Cambridge. Her supervisor, Antony Hewish, ended up winning a Nobel prize for the discovery. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c26b1bc9544251b18f0d1eab1c6d5ca3/5E561ACC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/43985975_497383457428655_8654257733906211228_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bpt3GuwgxMQ/", "caption": "Today is Colin Kaepernick's birthday 🎉 and so we reflect on his legacy. 👏 \"It seems that black athletes are allowed a single role, their humanity and personal politics flattened, even erased.

She is a certified yoga teacher, she regularly mountain climbs and ice-skates, and on Nov. 4 she is taking on the New York City Marathon ― on crutches. Gavios, now 25, became paralyzed in 2016 when, in an effort to escape an attacker, she fell off a 150-foot cliff in Thailand and fractured her spine. The attacker discovered her and proceeded to assault her for hours. The next morning, she was rescued and taken to a hospital in Phuket for a spinal fusion. While she still has function in her hips, quads and hamstrings, the injury has affected movement in areas like her ankles, feet, calves and glutes. She walks with a cane and uses her upper body strength to propel herself. “My parents flew in, and we were there for 18 days,” she recalled for HuffPost. “Then I was doing inpatient therapy at Mount Sinai Hospital [in New York], and since then I’ve just been recovering.” That recovery has included physical therapy and building up her other muscles to compensate for the ones that are paralyzed. While she has use of much of the lower half of her body, she is unable to feel her feet and ankles. She embarked on extensive physical therapy program, refusing to give up when things got tough. She even learned krav maga, a form of self-defense developed for the Israeli military. When her sister sent her a photo of Amanda Sullivan, a woman who crutched the New York City Marathon in 2017, Gavios’ newest challenge seemed clear. “It just inspired me so much to also do it,” she said. She is participating in the marathon on behalf of the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation to raise money for spinal cord injury research. “My goal right now is to run and be able to walk again without assistance,” she said. “I’m raising money for spinal cord injury research to speed up a process that will not only benefit me but 5.4 million Americans with paralysis.” She has so far raised almost $7,000 of a $15,000 goal. // Story by: @realgirlproject // 📸: Hannah Gavios", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b1e5cac46f4214eb64ae3e0b4eb884af/5E431D87/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/44210029_2161287210858383_159716535411480337_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bpo-usIlWIh/", "caption": "Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, recently reminded the world that \"feminism is about fairness.\" ✨ She continues to be the most outspoken royal on the subject of feminism. 👏👏👏👏 // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5ba349d1364c1a2a8a991c9246ed987a/5E5841AA/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/43696909_2129987840357182_7584841139927394222_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BpnfGEuDfqk/", "caption": "Ciara won Halloween as Nakia from the #BlackPanther movie 👏.

The suspect, 46-year-old Robert Bowers, had a history of posting racist and anti-Jewish statements online and reportedly yelled during the attack, “All Jews must die.” After the attack, Trump called out the “evil Anti-Semitic attack” as an “assault on humanity.” Later that day, the president went ahead with plans to attend two events, a Future Farmers of America Convention in Indiana ― where he joked about having a “bad hair day” ― and a rally in Murphysboro, Illinois. The letter from Pharrell’s lawyers said the artist “has not and will not” allow Trump to “publicly” play “any of his music” and asked that he “cease and desist from any further unauthorized use.” // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f8b0a6e048b3dbe7258443125a729eae/5E5A0CD2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/43985497_270233920296785_4340247339857300061_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bpjyu2_AboB/", "caption": "Jim Carrey continues his support for Colin Kaepernick. 👏 🇺🇸 // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4b10760f2ecde092262f134e9c2d4518/5E5DDF38/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/43915128_254617108589906_552078510073663489_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BpiQVEiDNiJ/", "caption": "Two Muslim groups are refusing to let religious hatred win. 💜 Celebrate Mercy and MPower Change have banded together to raise money for their Jewish brothers and sisters at Tree of Life Or L’Simcha Congregation, which was the target of Saturday’s attack.

Violations are punishable by a $5,000 fine, plus an additional $1,000 for each day the violation continues. ■ Animal tests used in the cosmetic industry include painful skin and eye irritancy experiments, as well as toxicity evaluations that involve exposing animals to deadly substances, sometimes by force-feeding or inhalation.

It’s not supposed to be like this. The #MeToo movement is in full swing. Many powerful men have been brought down in the face of credible accusations of sexual misconduct. “Women are being believed, for the first time ever,” #GloriaSteinem told HuffPost earlier this year. Are they? Steinem added a huge caveat back then ― one that is painfully relevant at this moment, as the Senate weighs the allegations against #Kavanaugh: It typically takes more than one woman for an accusation to stick. In campus sexual assault cases, for example, Steinem said, “It takes four or five women accusing the same guy before it’s believed.” Indeed, in almost all the most high-profile Me Too cases ― Harvey Weinstein, Les Moonves, Charlie Rose, Matt Lauer ― it took more than one woman to bring down a single man, no matter how credible the accusation. In other words, *yes*, women are being believed ― but it’s not entirely clear that a woman will be found credible. Particularly when she’s going up against the pinnacle of American male power ― a prep school and Ivy League-educated lawyer with immense political connections. Kavanaugh’s supporters were out in full force on Monday attacking Blasey Ford’s credibility, just as Hill was attacked decades ago. Thomas’ ascension to the court triggered a wave of women running for office. Just as pussy-grabber-in-chief Trump’s election spurred women’s marches, inspired more women to run for office and, arguably, galvanized the Me Too movement. And yet, for all that, we’re somehow back to a 1990s-style moment. What happens next will be a test to see how far we’ve come ― have women gained real credibility?

But Osaka was robbed of something else: her agency, her identity, her story, and her blackness. In interviews, Osaka has been adamant about embracing both her Asian and black heritages, conceding that while she represents Japan in sporting events, she doesn’t identify solely as Japanese. She proudly reps her Haitian side. Yet Osaka’s biracial identity is inconvenient in a racist narrative that turns Williams into a stereotype. It’s more expedient to focus on all the things about her that aren’t stereotypically black: her light skin, her soft-spoken nature, her tear-filled apology after winning the match. In this way, Osaka is framed if not as a white woman, then as a more acceptable and palatable version of blackness ― as the type of black person that doesn’t make you acknowledge their blackness. But there are actually two narratives at play here. There’s the one in which Osaka is reduced to a silent and silenced victim; tearful; not quite white, but not black either. Reporters ask her whether Williams’s “behavior” made Osaka lose respect for her, reinforcing coded stereotypes that have everything to do with colorism, model minority myths and the culture’s implicit hatred of black women like Serena Williams. And then there’s this other, opposing, well-meaning narrative that paints Williams as a feminist crusader, fighting for women’s rights and against double standards in a sport that most definitely has treated her unfairly on the basis of both race and gender in the past. But it wasn’t a matter of villain and victim, good and bad, black and white. Williams is an icon, a legend. And she’s a fallible and whole human being. Just as Osaka is more than just Japanese, more than tearful and endearingly apologetic.

The two said that they were both understandably going to be stepping away from work for a while to take care of Noah. ▪️Though their son’s health is improving, the singer said it’s still hard to talk about exactly what the family went through. // 📸: Getty Images", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d7400b257668199360468df93c0a9521/5E40CD89/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/39881701_1838240986265942_6523228386800697344_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm1AQwOF7Gv/", "caption": "Everything happens for a Riesling. 😂 🍷 This is so hilarious and clever: Writer and artist Michael James Schneider (@blcksmth) made a makeshift boyfriend out of boxed wines after breaking up with his actual human boyfriend. ■ “Since I didn’t have a boyfriend anymore, I made one myself out of the discarded wine boxes I ‘self-medicated’ with, along with some boxes others friends donated,” he told HuffPost of the jokey art project. ■ The pics ― taken by Portland photographer Cole Keister ― are extra funny thanks in large part to Schneider’s pals’ hyped-up reactions. // 📸: @coleito // Story by: @binnywong", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5d0af5b535c6c0f2d3540375b02b24b4/5E4AFAB5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1080.1080a/s640x640/38860493_516504502114021_3432357001890365440_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm0sgerFNlu/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/752540de608058724571cabb01be03ad/5DC18A0A/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/39406549_2214222182145134_6325029939741458432_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bmy38d9HnLj/", "caption": "Kelly Marie Tran is speaking out for the first time since she wiped her Instagram account in June after months of racist and sexist online harassment. ■ “Their words seemed to confirm what growing up as a woman and a person of color already taught me: that I belonged in margins and spaces, only valid as a minor character in their lives and stories,” Tran wrote in an essay for The New York Times. ■ “And those words awakened something deep inside me ― a feeling I thought I had grown out of,” she continued. “Their words reinforced a narrative I had heard my whole life: that I was ‘other,’ that I didn’t belong, that I wasn’t good enough, simply because I wasn’t like them.

It is also a reward I bestowed on myself after finally learning to swim just one year ago. ■ One might think, with my wrinkled face and gray hair, I would have instead turned to cosmetic surgery to mark my upcoming milestone birthday ― wouldn’t that make me more youthful? Wouldn’t a face-lift help attract a swain? But after a first marriage that ended in divorce and second in widowhood ― not to mention the cushy contentment I experience in my current single life ― I’ve decided not to go that chancy route. (And if the grimaces given by guys my age are a true indication of how they feel about tattoos, I may just stay happily single forever.) ■ I have never been envious of friends who chose to have their foreheads planed, their eyelids lifted or their cheeks enhanced. That’s their call. It’s the “elective” part of these elective procedures that has always put me off. Why enter a hospital willingly, I think to myself. I’ll wait until a dire discovery demands admission. ■ The anxiety of the anesthesia-free procedure I elected to have was eased because Graciela is my second #tattoo. As a longtime admirer of the art and boldness of others with #tattoos, I decided to mark my 60th birthday with a tribute to my two daughters. ■ So, I got a piece on my left bicep featuring a heart, musical notes and their names, Faith and Jill.
