In Gambia, treating that pain, he says, \"can be difficult.\"\n3.The operating theater at the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital is split in half so two surgeries can happen simultaneously.

The Assad regime has waged a war against civilians, jailing tens of thousands who are packed into filthy cells where thousands have been tortured and killed.
