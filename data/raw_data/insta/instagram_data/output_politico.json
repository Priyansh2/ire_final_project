The extraordinary texts were exchanged between then-Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker, U.S. Ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland, and Bill Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and longtime Foreign Service officer who has served as the chargé d'affaires for the country since June. They worked for months to try to carry out the president's demands.\n\nThe texts offer further evidence that the White House wanted to make the U.S. relationship with Zelensky conditional on Ukraine investigating his political rival — the subject of House Democrats’ deepening impeachment inquiry. On Friday, Trump denied any quid pro quo, but the texts suggest otherwise.

He’s mused obliquely to other officials about executing them. He’s attacked reporters by name. He rails frequently against media accounts of his administration, dismissing them as “fake news.” But privately, Trump is so obsessed with the leaks about him that he has frequently discussed whether to order polygraphs of White House staffers after major disclosures, according to four former White House officials. This would be a stark and politically risky departure from past practice. In fact, Trump “constantly” talks about ordering polygraphs during major leaks, according to a former White House official.

Only three presidents have served in their 70s — Donald Trump, Ronald Reagan and Dwight Eisenhower — and no president ever has finished a term at the age Biden would begin his.\n\nBut this isn’t just about Biden’s age — it’s about ours, and the tension between baby boomers and the generations lined up behind them, wondering when they’re going to get a chance to take over.

To back up their claim, the House’s legal team — led by House General Counsel Douglas Letter — cited a passage in Mueller’s report about former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s testimony that he “recalled” Trump asking to be kept “updated” about WikiLeaks’ disclosures of Democratic National Committee emails.\n\nThere is a grand-jury redaction in that passage, the lawyers note. “The text redacted ... and any underlying evidence to which it may point are critical to the committee’s investigation,” they wrote. “Those materials therefore have direct bearing on whether the president was untruthful, and further obstructed the special counsel’s investigation, when in providing written responses to the special counsel’s questions he denied being aware of any communications between his campaign and WikiLeaks,” they added.
