His announcement comes amid reports that he pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his family.\n***\nEarlier in the day, Trump told reporters at the United Nations that he ordered his staff to freeze almost $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the call. The reason? Fighting corruption and making sure Europe shares the burden of aiding Ukraine, according to the president. “As far as withholding funds, those funds were paid,” Trump said. “They were fully paid. But my complaint has always been, and I’d withhold again and I’ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine.” The president also suggested, without evidence, that the Biden family inappropriately benefited from ties to Ukraine. The president's allegation stems from Hunter Biden's work with a Ukrainian gas company in 2014 as Biden’s father, the former vice president, was part of American efforts to support a newly installed, pro-Western government.\n***\nThe entire episode has prompted renewed calls from Democrats for a formal impeachment inquiry. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been reluctant to endorse those calls in the past, is expected to announce a formal impeachment inquiry on Tuesday afternoon. 📷: Spencer Platt/Getty Images.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4ddf90191726b4e38904ca17de209543/5E4F526E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c180.0.720.720a/s640x640/71208615_174198887075847_3573598086971580021_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2xF6goHODX/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1804b9c75f5aa8844049a2e1d17dd4db/5DBDC180/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.200.720.720a/s640x640/70775923_2450523135218474_376837496290168462_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2woMccH8eO/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e78ac4c63fe49574be45c8c2b46d2d13/5DBE7E80/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71269496_535146147295871_5078258553917410740_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2pvLtbpMco/", "caption": "Millions of young people in 139 countries around the world took to the streets to protest the growing threat of #ClimateChange.

And, one-by-one, they were attached to the wall and to other messages with a brown piece of tape. The tributes are singular and universal at the same time.\n\nSome are simple in their adoration, echoing the many ways mothers care for us. Many describe how their mothers made them feel. Others write about a specific memory, the kind our brains latch onto in some of the most mundane ways. The smallest tasks loom large in our minds from crimping our hair in the mornings to her always wearing jeans. \"My mommy always brought me M&Ms when she picked us up at day care,\" one person wrote.\n\nSeveral are in other languages, Spanish, Arabic. Our mommies are shelters, shoulders to cry on, idols of perseverance. We remember their laughter, smiles and being there \"through thick and thin.\" Others learned about God from their mothers. \"My mom is as fearless as a New York pigeon,\" another wrote.
