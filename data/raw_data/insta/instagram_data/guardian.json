The Met Office suggests that the warm weather will continue in the next couple of days, before getting colder again by the end of the week. But scientists say the continuing warm winter weather is a cause for concern, as destructive and dangerous weather like heat waves, droughts and flooding will be on the rise again this year as the earth continues to warm up. Global warming is likely to make 2019 the hottest year in human history. According to National Geographic, the Earth‚Äôs climate has been warmer over the last 406 consecutive months than the entire average in the 20th century, which means no one under the age of 32 has ever experienced a cooler-than-average month. \nPhoto: Henry Nicholls/Reuters .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.#Sunshine #uk #warmweather #heatwave #ceredigion #wales  #globalwarming #climatechange #February", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/aa5d1495219d5765e20f98c6dc4bbb4c/5E41BA56/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/51544902_291231111568736_8083556477367656739_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuUA6xCHW-R/", "caption": "Olivia Colman has won her first Oscar.

The Japanese government is expected to justify their move by arguing that these species have now recovered sufficiently in the last 30 years. A fisheries agency official denied the news agency's report, and insisted that while they want to resume commercial whaling as soon as possible, no decision has been made on whether to withdraw from the IWC.

We do it for ourselves.\"", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b59fef5c2a77c1a8dcf74238996b7008/5E58C653/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/35256850_1751231484961629_85433110040150016_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BkTMJRpAgXx/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e18f298c2c110756d2577ae8e9a53dd0/5DC1CEAB/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/35617195_621195138248044_3280876146765332480_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BkScyWkl00n/", "caption": "The Gorilla Foundation has announced the death of Koko the gorilla.

When we were excited about a song.\" #RIPChester", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5934e619c10e2fae6e21a93d00e51dd4/5E63DF83/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/20180719_373550196393760_6374461865107390464_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BWxkPc8Bbhr/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/93ba41fe3dce40320b04761ec1735dad/5DC1A6B4/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/20181430_295507487519506_709537621025488896_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BWxHJZoBbbi/", "caption": "It's been revealed that only a third of the BBC's 96 top earners are women and the top seven are all men.

Just how important it was, not just to the LGBT community but for all of us to see somebody so full of kindness and light, somebody we liked so much, somebody who could be our neighbour or our colleague or our sister, challenge our own assumptions. Remind us that we have more in common than we realise. Push our country in the direction of justice. What an incredible burden that was to bear. To risk your career like that, people don‚Äôt do that very often. And then to have the hopes of millions on your shoulders. But it‚Äôs like Ellen says, ‚ÄúWe all want a tortilla chip, that can support the weight of guacamole.‚Äù Which really makes no sense to me. But I thought would break the mood because I was getting kind of choked up. And she did pay a price. We don‚Äôt remember this. I hadn‚Äôt remembered it. She did, for a pretty long stretch of time, even in Hollywood.
