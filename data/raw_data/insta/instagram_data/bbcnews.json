There will be two weddings for the British Royal Family to celebrate in 2018 with the news that the cousin of Princes William and Harry is marrying her long-term boyfriend. It comes just months after Harry and Meghan Markle announced they were engaged. The youngest daughter of the Duke of York, Eugenie is expected to tie the knot in Windsor this autumn, but an official date hasn't been confirmed yet.

Many people believe that the modern image of Santa comes from the work of Thomas Nast, an artist who drew for the magazine Harpers Weekly. He painted Santa from 1863 to 1886 and in 1869 illustrated a book called Santa Claus and His Works. The book showed how Santa manufactured toys for boys and girls at his home at the North Pole.  The colours of his suit are widely thought to derive from the original Saint Nicholas, who was the Bishop of Myra in the 4th Century. Red and white were the hues of traditional bishop robes, although some historians argue that he originally dressed in different colours.

In a BBC interview she describes him as a \"predator\", rather than a sex addict. She says he's at the top of a system of \"harassment, belittling and bullying and interference\" that has been part of women's world \"since time immemorial\". A large number of women have come forward to claim they were sexually harassed by Weinstein, with four accusing him of rape.

Wildlife photographer @justinhofman spotted this little guy floating around in the waters of Indonesia. We reached out to Justin to ask about his photo which has since gone viral. \"At first I was so happy to find this cute sea horse all alone but as the tide changed, sea grass and debris started to drift over the reef - and plastic, trash and sewage along with it. The white blobs you see in the background are actually plastic bags. As the whole thing unfolded, I knew it was an important scene that had to be documented. It was frustrating, disgusting and sad but I had to shoot it.\" The photo is also part of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year contest - on show at the Natural History Museum in London. #wpy53 #photography #wildlife #seacreature #seahorse #earbud #plasticbags #plastic #wildlifephotography #conservation\n@eyosexpeditions @nhm_wpy @sea_legacy", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/42127f0aac78900da00989cd821863e9/5E5C5AA5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/21688783_1933957750201656_95063878416728064_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BZBzycMntBS/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/48dea2a09d36963a7a51978aa64c2465/5DBCD7E2/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/21689190_272395049832067_2491548341301673984_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BZBkTFOH0qL/", "caption": "The shortlist for the 2017 Wildlife Photographer of The Year has been announced.\nAn Arctic fox carries its prize egg after raiding a snow goose nest on Wrangel Island in Russia.
