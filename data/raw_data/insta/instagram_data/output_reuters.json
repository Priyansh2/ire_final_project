Hundreds of thousands of students and workers left their schools, colleges and offices and marched along city streets around the globe to demand that world leaders take urgent action to avert an environmental catastrophe. The global climate strike, inspired by the 16-year-old activist, kicked off in the Pacific islands and followed the rising sun across Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia and then on to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Americas. It will culminate in New York when Thunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, will spearhead a rally at the United Nations headquarters, where heads of government are due to gather for a climate summit next week.

Mild federal effort is in place to extinguish the fires - which are burning for the past 3-4 weeks and still going strong. Local resources only are insufficient to cope with this tragedy.\nWhen asked about the fires, some high government officials replied they had more important things to do. The Minister of environmental issues, found guilty on charges of environmental fraud a few years ago in favor of mining corporations (one of them involved in the recent Brasil Paraguai energy scandal), was quoted by saying the region \"needs to be monetized\". Even the president himself, an extreme right winger, proved totally inept for the job, made up stories NGOs were setting fire to the region just to make his already pitiful government look bad(as if needed). Much of the funds used to deal with climate change and fire prevention were extinct or blocked. Some argue that fires are payback for 2018 electoral support by mining corp, farmers, loggers, and financial groups, who have major interests in the region. Local press reported farmers planned the action and called it Fire Day days before. Etc.\nAnd for Brazil's sovereignty argument, let's keep in mind there are no frontiers in environmental issues - it affects the whole world, it's a global problem. The US use of fracking in oil extraction, German car makers fraudulent reports on CO2 emissions, Chinese factories air pollution, massive Canadian wood burning, etc. are all global issues. The list goes on and on.\nEither Brazil takes the lead on this matter or some G7/China/Russia reasonable and acceptable excuse will be used to finally take control of the region - an objective these countries have pursued since their economies started depending heavily on models which pollute the world (which makes one wonder: was this the plan all along?).

But the celebrity event has turned controversial. A federal minister announced on 2 September that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation would recognise Mr Modi for his government's efforts to end open defecation. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, as it is known, or Clean India Mission, seeks to improve sanitation across the country by building tens of millions of toilets for the poor. Hundreds of millions of Indians defecate in the open because they have no access to toilets or even running water. It has been a persistent problem, polluting soil and water, causing diseases and putting women and girls at risk as they go out alone in the night to relieve themselves.\nSo Mr Modi's ambitious promise in 2014 that he would end this practice caught the attention of India and the world. And that goal lies at the heart of the Clean India Mission, arguably Mr Modi's most beloved campaign. He and his Bharatiya Janata Party-led government have claimed and touted it as a success - and in the run-up to this year's election, Mr Modi claimed that thanks to the programme, 90% of Indians now have access to a toilet, up from 40% before he came to office. While it's true that the number of toilets has increased significantly, a BBC investigation found that many of them are not working or aren't being used for various reasons, from lack of running water to poor maintenance to deeply ingrained cultural habits. Recent research found that people in some parts of northern India preferred to defecate in the open because they found it more \"comfortable\" or thought it to be \"part of a wholesome, healthy virtuous life\". \"Before the Swachh Bharat mission, over 500 million people in India did not have access to safe sanitation, ...”"}, {"author": "dinamrcia", "comment": "👏👏👏👏❤️"}, {"author": "jonthestone", "comment": "Pour le climat mettez la clim a la mosson ce soir @paulbernardoni @zinedine_ferhat8 @sofiane_alkch @briatos23 @rips_20 🙏 @zonathe"}, {"author": "zonathe", "comment": "@jonthestone haha 🤣"}, {"author": "b.a.n.a_me", "comment": "the guy is using a PLASTIC single use bottle as a gas mask🤦‍♂️...irony or just asinine?"}, {"author": "sayan123nandy456", "comment": "@b.a.n.a_me its called reusing and Kushal da- the guy here is using this and inside there is a living plant.

Engloba os estados do Acre, Amapá, Amazonas, Mato Grosso, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima e Tocantins e parte do Maranhão. Com sua retomada, o controle do desmatamento foi viabilizado, promovendo queda recorde, atinginda em 2012, e se mantendo dentro de limites aceitáveis até 2015, quando voltou a mostrar sinais de crescimento.\nEm 2019, até julho, alertas do sistema Deter, da Imazon, mostraram quase 7mil km2 devastados na região. Julho, pior mês da série histórica, teve perda equivalente a área do estado do RJ neste único mês - e ainda faltam dados oficiais de agosto, que incluem as dezenas de milhares de queimadas registradas pela NASA.\nSó em 2019, o governo ameaça sair do acordo de Paris e perder bilhões do fundo GCF, cortou 95% das verbas p/estudos de mudanças climáticas e 38% do orçamento de combate a incêndios florestais, bloqueou $90milhões do Ibama(multas ambientais), perdeu milhões em apoio da Alemanha/Noruega (acabou com o Fundo Amazônia), demitiu o pres. do INPE por alertar às queimadas desde janeiro, tentou fundir o Min da Agricultura com o do Meio Ambiente, colocou na pasta do Meio Ambiente um condenado por fraude ambiental, tentou por a Funai (demarcação de terras indígenas)na Agricultura, editou a MP881 que facilita (até dispensa!) obter licenças p/queimadas, discursou contra politicas ambientais, etc.\nEm 2019, atingimos um ponto tão crítico que, a deixar descontrolado com está e sem recursos como maliciosamente planejado, regrediremos rápido às taxas exibidas antes da retomada do Amazônia Legal.
