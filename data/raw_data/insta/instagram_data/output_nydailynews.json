A senior at North Carolina Central University was shot and killed Monday, September 17th in his apartment complex Campus Crossing at Durham by a security guard employed by NC Detective Agency who’s name has YET to be released. And no charges have been filed by the Durham Police Department. The security guard is claiming he shot DeAndre in “self-defense”. The story produced by this agency definitely does not add up nor sounds like any behavior and acts of DeAndre at all. His family was not notified of his death until DAYS after the incident. We all just thought he was missing AND a missing person report was filled. We need help getting answers and Justice for DeAndre Ballard. He was one of the purest, kindest, and humbled person I know. With all these killings happening by persons of “authority” UNJUSTLY. I never in A million years would think I would it hit home to someone very close to me. PLEASE SHARE HIS STORY. SHARE! SHARE!

In 1839, 53 illegally purchased African slaves (acquired from a Cuban Importer) being transported from Cuba aboard the Spanish-built schooner staged a successful mutiny. They were later intercepted by an American brig off the coast of Long Island and thrown in jail along with the remainder of the Schooner’s crew who were not murdered. The Schooner was not an American-flagged vessel. While President Martin Van Buren was among those who favored extraditing the Africans to Cuba, under a formal request by the Cuban Governor, they were eventually allowed a trial, and a federal district court judge ruled they were not liable for their actions. Former president John Quincy Adams argued on behalf of the slaves when the appeal was brought before the U.S. Supreme Court, which eventually determined the Africans to be free men.
