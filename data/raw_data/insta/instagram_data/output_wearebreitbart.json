Your move, Democrats. 🇺🇸🇺🇸 Peter Navarro, a senior White House adviser to President Donald Trump and the director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, is out with a new White House video provided exclusively to Breitbart News calling on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold a vote this month in the House on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement. “The U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement is far more important than any China deal,” Navarro says in the video, provided exclusively to Breitbart News. “America has almost twice the amount of trade with Canada and Mexico than it does with China, but more importantly the U.S. exports five times as many products to Mexico and Canada than it does to China, where trade is a one-way street moving in the wrong direction. There are only a few days left in the legislative calendar before the end of 2019. If Nancy Pelosi fails to put the USMCA up for a vote this month, it will be a signal failure of our political process and an economic catastrophe.” Pelosi has also not scheduled any votes on USMCA, the trade agreement that the Trump administration has negotiated with Canada and Mexico in an effort to replace the highly unpopular North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton—a Republican and a Democrat—ushered into being.\n\nNavarro laying out how USMCA would be more significant to the United States than any trade deal with China is also important, because as he points out the U.S. conducts almost twice as much trade with both countries than with China and, even more importantly, five times as many exports.", "comments": [{"author": "marilyn.aka.trouble", "comment": "Bet Pelosi won’t do it.

Adam Schiff’s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held a meeting during the trip with acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, now a key witness for Democrats pursuing impeachment.\n\nThe Atlantic Council is funded by and works in partnership with Burisma, the natural gas company at the center of allegations regarding Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Taylor has been called by House Democrats to appear next week to provide a deposition as part of the investigation being led by Schiff into President Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Taylor himself has evidenced a close relationship with the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council, writing analysis pieces published on the Council’s website and serving as a featured speaker for the organization’s events. He also served for nine years as senior advisor to the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, which has co-hosted scores of events with the Atlantic Council.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Thomas Eager, a staffer on Schiff’s House Intelligence Committee, took a trip to Ukraine in August billed as a bipartisan “Ukraine Study Trip” in which ten Congressional staffers participated.\n\nEager is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship, a bipartisan program that says it “educates congressional staff on current events in the Eurasia region.” The pre-planned Ukraine trip was part of the fellowship program. Burisma in January 2017 signed a “cooperative agreement” with the Council to specifically sponsor the organization’s Eurasia Center, the same center that sponsored Eager’s Ukraine trip.\n\nA closer look at the itinerary for the August 24 to August 31 trip shows that the delegation’s first meeting upon arrival in Ukraine was with Taylor. Spokespeople for Schiff’s office did not reply to multiple Breitbart News requests sent over the course of the last three days for comment on Eager’s meeting with Taylor.", "comments": [{"author": "studie57", "comment": "We have to get the story straight see, all seven of them see.

The billboard, entitled “Lady Liberty,” features model Michal Mesa, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, stepping on a distressed-looking President Trump’s face outside the White House. “As a former US Marine, I was proud to serve my country and help protect the rights of our citizens,” Mesa said in a statement. “Perhaps now more than ever, it’s crucial we take a powerful stand against those who are determined to strip Americans of our rights. I’m proud to represent Lady Liberty and hope it inspires more people to take a stand.” “Enough is enough. Our customers and our team are empowered, outspoken, and active.

Now Sleepy Joe has real problems! Reminds me of Crooked Hillary and her 33,000 deleted Emails, not recoverable!” the president wrote on Twitter.\nIn an interview that aired earlier Tuesday, Biden — the son of 2020 Democrat White House hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden — denied allegations of wrongdoing in relation to his business dealings in China and Ukraine. Yet he did concede to exhibiting poor judgment by establishing ties to foreign commercial entities. “In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part,” Biden told ABC News interviewer Amy Robach. “Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don’t believe now when I look back on it — I know that there was — did nothing wrong at all. However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in—in—in many ways? Yeah.” “So I take full responsibility for that,” the younger Biden continued. “Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever. Did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.” Later in the interview, Biden conceded he would “probably not” have served as a board member of Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings if he were not the son of a vice president. “I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,” he said. “That’s where I made the mistake.”", "comments": [{"author": "josephebaudler", "comment": "He’d done better if not on cocaine, I bet."}, {"author": "dennygillis", "comment": "He and daddy are contradicting one another. 😂"}, {"author": "si_vis_pacem_para_bellum_deez", "comment": "They are coming for you joey"}, {"author": "allinadays", "comment": "Yea he was pitiful"}, {"author": "darcypan0324", "comment": "He’s a dumb crackhead.

Back in 2013-2014, the White House put Biden in charge of Ukraine and a number of specific issues regarding the Chinese government. Riding his father’s coattails, and without any experience with either Ukraine or in the energy sector, Hunter secured a seat on the board of Burisma, where he was paid an incredible $50,000 a month — a month! — to the eventual tune of, according to some reports, three million dollars. In China, Hunter literally hitched a ride on Air Force Two with his dad to Beijing and secured a $1.5 billion — with a “B” — deal that could, according to FactCheck.org, eventually earn him tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnd what has been the real-world result of what stinks like a couple of foreign bribes…? Well, we have Joe Biden on video bragging about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, a prosecutor who, under penalty of perjury, says he was investigating Burisma. To get this prosecutor fired, Biden admits to muscling Ukraine’s government into a quid pro quo: no U.S. aid unless you fire the guy.\n\nUkraine fired the guy. And then there’s Joe Biden’s sucking up to the same Chinese government that — through the Bank of China — handed a company in which Hunter has a ten percent stake in a cool $1.5 billion.\n\nWhen confronted with these obvious and utterly shameless conflicts of interest, the media allow Biden to hide behind his outrage over his integrity being challenged coupled with his now-debunked lie about never having discussed these shady overseas business deals with Hunter.", "comments": [{"author": "cjanego1946", "comment": "😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹"}, {"author": "stevieb117", "comment": "@glennbeck"}, {"author": "carrierhc2", "comment": "😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈👹👹👹👹"}, {"author": "psychoactivepodcast", "comment": "Trumps crooked.

Under two of the models, Trump is forecast to win with more than the 304 electoral college votes he garnered in 2016. “Under the average of the three models, Trump would hold on to key industrial Midwest states and pick up New Hampshire, Virginia and Minnesota,” Moody’s said in a report detailing the results of its models. Moody’s election forecasts have been very reliable in the past, correctly predicting every election result except 2016. The model undercounted support for Trump because it did not anticipate the increase in voter turnout that shifted the majority vote in crucial states.\n\nImportantly, Moody’s models all predict Trump wins even if the economy dips to multiyear lows by the end of 2020 and the stock market crashes 9 percent.

In 2007, Daniel Gire was in Iraq saving the lives of fellow Marines when a grenade struck him, sending several pieces of shrapnel into his body. Shortly after he was hit with the grenade, he was shot in the back as he tried to escape, WSAV reported.\n\nThe Marines awarded Daniel a Silver Star and a Purple Heart for his actions during the Iraq War.\n\nBut life has been hard for Daniel since he came home from the battlefield. Daniel has undergone multiple surgeries to heal his wounds. He also has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and has undergone hours of therapy to cope with it. “To think, a place like Building Houses of Heroes gave us this opportunity to give us that glimmer of hope, that beacon, it’s phenomenal,” Crystal Gire said.\n\nThe gifted home is part of the organization’s promise to serve injured veterans who fought for our country after September 11, 2001. “The family was amazing to work with. We really try to keep that relationship with the families. It’s their safe spot, their place to plant their roots, and start new,” said Cody Brannon, with Building Homes for Heroes. Daniel and Crystal told WTGS the option of having children was never on the table before they received the house but say they are now excited to start a family of their own someday.", "comments": [{"author": "stevenbergh2019", "comment": "Isis and Blm uncervover agents are murdering the veterans!!

Thank you for being the smartest, coolest freedom fighters anywhere on the web.

Breitbart News captured the greatest “share of voice” on Facebook among U.S. news outlets during the debate, while Fox News came in second place and the President’s personal Facebook page came in third. CNN, which hosted the debate, received approximately one third of the number of engagements that Breitbart News earned during the debate. The New York Times, which co-hosted the Democrat debate alongside CNN, did not even break the list of the top ten social media pages with the highest “share of voice” on Facebook. Breitbart News has consistently topped polls on social media interaction during this election cycle. It was reported by Axios in July that Breitbart News was dominating the political landscape during the Democrat primaries. During July, 18 of the top 30 stories about the top Democrat presidential candidates came from conservative news media; five of those stories were from Breitbart News.", "comments": [{"author": "marisellsaustin", "comment": "🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"}, {"author": "matt___ello", "comment": "Suuuure"}, {"author": "johnnyrychuss", "comment": "I like many of your stories.

Instead, bring the six-pack of any beer you like, open one of them and hold it in your hand. Put the rest on the front passenger seat next to you. Take your loaded gun and place it on the dashboard. Screw out both license plates and leave them in the garage.\n\nThen, drive.\n\nGo to the nearest highway or a major street. Find the police cruiser or a highway patrol car. Flash your open beer to them. Run on red light. Speed up. Pass another car on a shoulder. Don't stop on a stop sign.\n\nAs the police go after you, don't stop. Go! Run! Flee!\n\nWhen you are finally get pulled over, don't open the window. In response to the police officer's knock on the glass and request to show your driver's license and registration, tell they are all have no legal right to stop you. Tell them, they chase you is a driver harassment and a witch-hunt. Refuse to follow their orders. Try to scare them by promising them to get them into a prison. Tell them they have no proofs and evidence of you breaking traffic laws. Dismiss all the videos and photographs they have. Call all the reports of your violent driving fake news. Tell them to go and fuck themselves.\n\nWell, your beloved president is doing the same thing to the Impeachment inquiry right now. So, you should do it too. If he can do it, why can't you?\n\nDo it, I dare you!\n\nI simply want to know what would happen next. What you are going to say in a courtroom.

In a so-called “whistleblower” complaint, the officer alleged the president pressured Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden — a charge both world leaders deny. In recent days, several reports have raised red flags regarding the officer’s credibility. According to the Washington Examiner, the officer is not only a registered Democrat but also previously worked with Biden in the White House during the Obama administration. Nonetheless, Wallace has claimed that the House Democrats’ impeachment probe is worth pursuing. “It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call. So, there’s going to be something here for Congress to investigate, whether it ends up rising to the levels of articles of impeachment, we don’t know,” the anchor said during a recent broadcast.", "comments": [{"author": "aujanjan", "comment": "He has gone off the deep end!"}, {"author": "_gbnance", "comment": "Wallace has disliked Trump from the start"}, {"author": "randy_865", "comment": "Literal retards"}, {"author": "jbakerthebword", "comment": "So ya like Schiff's schitt, do ya, Chris?"}, {"author": "grammy.texas", "comment": "Don’t trust wallace"}, {"author": "therealsteakhouse", "comment": "Chris Wallace is a dem working fir Fox News.

However, a comparison by Gizmodo shows the video was captured at Knob Creek Gun Range in West Point, Kentucky back in 2017. “[I]t’s clear that the videos are the same,” said the website. On Sunday, ABC News anchor Tom Llamas aired some of the footage, reporting that it showed “the situation rapidly spiraling out of control in northern Syria.” “One week since President Trump ordered U.S. forces out of that region, effectively abandoning America’s allies in the fight against [ISIS],” Llamas framed the purported scoop. “This video right here appearing to show Turkey’s military bombing Kurd civilians in a Syrian border town,” he went on. “The Kurds, who fought alongside the U.S. against ISIS. Now, horrific reports of atrocities committed by Turkish-backed fighters on those very allies.” ABC News has since released a statement in which it issued a correction and apology for the error. “[W]e’ve taken down video that aired on World News Tonight Sunday and Good Morning America this morning that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy.

That won't work because without jobs the middle-class becomes the poor. Since funding will go down then the research for cures end. That leaves more and more sick and that leads to death panels. All the high taxes without jobs leads to unrest and unrest leads to reeducation camps. But the funding for healthcare will soon run out so free healthcare will switch to only a select few. Oh and there is absolutely no money for free college but that will not matter because people will be scraping for food.

The RNC, which had $59.2 million in cash on hand last month, has nearly tripled the DNC fundraising in the current cycle, the political committee said. “While Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month—the highest ever off-cycle—to show for it,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to Fox News. “Voters are tired of Democrats’ petty politics and baseless witch hunts, and their shameful attacks have only energized our grassroots army and allowed us to lay the groundwork for Republicans to take back the House, expand our majority in the Senate and re-elect President Trump in 2020.” The report follows a joint announcement by President Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign and the RNC in which they said a whopping combined $125.7 million was raised in the third quarter of 2019. The RNC will use some of the money raised to fund “Stop the Madness,” an anti-impeachment ad campaign designed to target vulnerable House Democrats running in moderate districts where voters are lukewarm to the idea of ousting the president. “Our goal is to cause chaos,” Rick Gorka, an RNC spokesperson, told Fox News. “This is a poison pill. When you couple the impeachment process with the socialist policies being espoused by 2020 Democrats, it’s going to sink their chances at the ballot box, especially with those crucial swing voters and independents across the country.”", "comments": [{"author": "rkmfrider", "comment": "Yay 🥃"}, {"author": "leilani9983", "comment": "Oh .

Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand responded by removing Columbus from power and replacing him with Francisco de Bobadilla, a member of the Order of Calatrava. Bobadilla, who ruled as governor from 1500 until his death in a storm in 1502, had also been tasked by the Court with investigating the accusations of brutality made against Columbus. Arriving in Santo Domingo while Columbus was away in the explorations of his third voyage, Bobadilla was immediately met with complaints about all three Columbus brothers: Christopher, Bartolomeo, and Diego. Bobadilla reported to Spain that Columbus regularly used torture and mutilation to govern Hispaniola. The 48-page report, found in 2006 in the national archive in the Spanish city of Simancas, contains testimonies from 23 people, including both enemies and supporters of Columbus, about the treatment of colonial subjects by Columbus and his brothers during his seven-year rule.[92]\n\nAccording to the report, Columbus once punished a man found guilty of stealing corn by having his ears and nose cut off and then selling him into slavery. Testimony recorded in the report stated that Columbus congratulated his brother Bartolomeo on \"defending the family\" when the latter ordered a woman paraded naked through the streets and then had her tongue cut out for suggesting that Columbus was of lowly birth.[92] The document also describes how Columbus put down native unrest and revolt; he first ordered a brutal crackdown in which many natives were killed and then paraded their dismembered bodies through the streets in an attempt to discourage further rebellion.[93] \"Columbus's government was characterised by a form of tyranny,\" Consuelo Varela, a Spanish historian who has seen the document, told journalists.[92] \"Even those who loved him had to admit the atrocities that had taken place.\"[92]\n\nBecause of their gross misgovernance, Columbus and his brothers were arrested and imprisoned upon their return to Spain from the third voyage."}, {"author": "cpny5", "comment": "It will always and forever be Columbus Day...

Bloomberg wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post urging Democrat candidates to explain how they would make their grandiose proposals a reality. The former mayor said it is likely the next president will face a “closely divided Congress.” Because of that, candidates need to explain how they would implement their ideas – such as Medicare for All and their multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposals. “Rarely are the candidates asked, and more rarely still do they talk about, how they would go about achieving their goals,” Bloomberg wrote. “The fact is: A legislative proposal is only as good as the execution plan that accompanies it. And even the best plans must be flexible enough to accommodate necessary changes, to prevent the perfect from being the enemy of the good,” he continued.

At the same time, expectations for earnings jumped to 2.54 percent from 2.26 percent. As a result, inflation-adjusted earnings expectations turned positive, rising to 0.06 percent. That might not seem like a huge positive but it is a record high in a metric that rarely even registers a figure above zero. Typically, the public’s expectations for inflation have outpaced expectations for earnings gains, suggesting the public expects to lose ground after price increases. The only two positive, non-zero readings on this measure were June and July of 2018, when the survey showed 0.05 percent expected real gains. The NY Fed’s survey data goes back to 2013.\n\nThe survey is constructed by asking the public where they expect their earnings to go if they kept the same job over the next year.\n\nAnother measure on the Fed survey asks about household income rather than individual earnings. This measure also hit a record high in inflation-adjusted terms, rising to a 0.45 percent improvement. This could provide support for consumer spending, a crucial force driving economic growth. Consumer expectations about household earnings can drive large purchases such as homes, cars, and major appliances.\n\nMany economic models of voter behavior also suggest that expectations for improving income can give a boost to incumbent candidates, suggesting that President Donald Trump may have a good chance of being re-elected. An analysis released recently by Moody’s said that Trump could easily beat his Democrat rivals even if the economy substantially deteriorates over the next year. Indeed, Moody’s “pocketbook” model–its most economically based–predicted Trump would “steamroll” his opponents.", "comments": [{"author": "lalu4wrb", "comment": "💙💪🏻🙏🏻👏🏻💙💖🙏🏻👏🏻💙💪🏻🙏🏻👏🏻💙💪🏻"}, {"author": "kathwhales", "comment": "My earnings aren’t going higher.

Although Hunter Biden’s lawyer has said that his client’s stake in the company is only valued at $420,000, a FactCheck.org analysis estimates it’s value to be millions. “It is difficult to imagine, if not incomprehensible, that a 10% stake in those economics is worth only $420K,” Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business told FactCheck.org. “The distinction they appear to be making is they capitalized the management company with $4.2 M even if the fund manages $2 B. The value of that management company is likely far in excess of $4.2 M if they are managing $2 B.” FactCheck.org cited Kaplan estimating that Hunter Biden’s share in the investment company could be valued at around $20 million and up to “hundreds of millions of dollars” over the investment lifetime.\n\nHunter Biden’s lawyer said that if Joe Biden won the race for president, he would agree “not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies,” but did not mention his current foreign investments in BHR.\n\nPresident Donald Trump continues to target Hunter Biden’s foreign investments as corrupt, questioning Vice President Joe Biden’s knowledge of his son capitalizing on his father’s specific diplomacy with China and Ukraine on behalf of former President Barack Obama’s administration.", "comments": [{"author": "jayrod808", "comment": "😡😡😡"}, {"author": "1jasonpennington", "comment": "Teeth whitening?"}, {"author": "lavendermickey", "comment": "Of course"}, {"author": "gmakc3", "comment": "Where’s the money HUNTER?"}, {"author": "happy_poppy_123", "comment": "😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡"}, {"author": "franchinaliz", "comment": "I’m sure!!!"}, {"author": "lester.hampton.7", "comment": "😮😮😮😮😮😮😮"}, {"author": "howardzane88", "comment": "If there is nothing wrong with what the Biden’s have done, why would they walk away from it if he was to become president?

A statement released on his behalf by his legal counsel George Mesires said his relationship with the management company of a private equity fund that’s backed by Chinese state-owned entities will end within weeks.

Hanach spoke to SiriusXM’s @siriusxm Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow @marlownews about the incident — which was caught on video — in a Wednesday interview for the show’s weekly TPUSA campus report. “[The man] came over and smashed our boards, and walked over to the trash can, felt the need to stuff them into the trash can, and told us to ‘stop spreading hate’ on our campus, which I don’t understand, because the boards he smashed were pro-liberty and pro-Second Amendment,” said Hanach on Wednesday. “It just shows that people on the left aren’t really willing to talk to us, they’d rather just destroy our property instead,” continued Hanach, adding that the incident had occurred just one day before the UNLV TPUSA group was set to host political commentator Tomi Lahren — which may have motivated the vandal’s anger. “I found that, especially on my campus, people don’t want to have debates, like those people that came and protested us before the event started, they left five minutes after we confronted them. They don’t want to have these talks, they don’t want to have these debates, they just want to shut us down — even if it means labeling moderate conservatives as hateful and racist people.”", "comments": [{"author": "texrpharmjd", "comment": "😡"}, {"author": "jeffmajor7", "comment": "Looks like a tool if he has that kind of time on his hands.

Go ahead and say different. You won't for fear of being offensive. To the left you need to grow a pair and really think for yourself instead of waiting for your all knowing democratic officials to tell you how to feel and think.
