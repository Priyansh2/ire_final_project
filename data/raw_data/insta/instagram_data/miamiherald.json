At back center is Principal Bernard Edwards. A renaming and dedication ceremony for the school, formerly Allapattah Middle School, was Saturday, Aug. 29, 2015. The Miami-Dade School Board on June 17, 2015, unanimously voted to rename the school after Jones-Ayers, a civil rights leader and community activist who died in February at age 86. Jones-Ayers grew up in the Railroad Shop Colored Addition neighborhood, now Allapattah, originally built for black railroad employees. In 1947, families were evicted from their homes in order to erect a school and park to serve the surrounding white families. Among her accomplishments, Jones-Ayers founded the Alternative Program, a pre-trial intervention program that also assists with post-release job placement. The school is at 1331 NW 46th St. Photo by Marsha Halper / Miami Herald staff\n\nSee a photo galleryfrom today's renaming ceremony of Allapattah Middle School to Georgia Jones-Ayers Middle School | hrld.us/1X0eFZF", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f5b77aa1ec7a2754f0f85f3ee4cef917/5E4D8D52/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/11909306_448981235286888_1226779712_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/68vxdmCznV/", "caption": "Home Depot employee Oscar Villaverde helps Iraida Rivera with a plywood purchase, Friday, Aug. 28, 2015, in Hollywood, Fla.
