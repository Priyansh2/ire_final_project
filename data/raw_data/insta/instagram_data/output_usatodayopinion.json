I searched on-line to know and enquirer about cure for HERPES and i read someone testimony on how he was cured from HSV-2 with a HERBAL MEDICINE. so i decided to contact the same herbalist called Dr_oaikhean5 because i know that nature has the power to heal everything. I contacted him to know how he can help me and he told me never to worry that he will heal me with the natural herbs from God! after 2 days of contacting him, he told me that the cure has been ready and he sent it to me via UPS and it got to me after 4 days! I used the med as he instructed me (Morning and Evening) on the 14 day of taking his herbal medicine, i was cured! its really like a dream but i am so happy! thats the reason i decided to also add more comment of Him so that more can be saved just like me! and if you need his help, you can email him on Dr_oaikhean@gmail.com or contact him via WhatsApp +2348110732593 God bless you", "author": "kacpergolden"}, {"comment": "üòéüòéüòé", "author": "sabrina_michelle18"}, {"comment": "How bout a Jewish one?

Now we need to understand that they dont bring the same revenue as men soccer does around the world. It will get there but it will also take some time. Just to understand a little more 20 years ago men soccer was not even close to pay players for their services what they pay today. At the same time 20 years ago women's soccer was not even a bit popular as it's getting now. I'm not against them getting a better pay, but everything is business and men soccer still brings more revenue that women's soccer these days.

And I will always answer; yes of course.\n\nFor 4 years I worked as S.A New Media to a Senator at the national assembly Washington DC USA and in 2016 during the period when Bitcoin was selling for less than $900 for 1 Bitcoin I paid Someone online to teach me Bitcoin Trading because before now I was an Ordinary Investor holding Bitcoin I bought way back.\nI tendered my resignation and left the National Assembly Washington DC in 2017 to face this Bitcoin trading as a full-time Job and up till now, I haven't regretted it for a day.\n\nTrading Bitcoin is definitely profitable and something a lot of people all over the world do daily to earn a living which I am one and I know many others as well.\n\nThe only issue with trading bitcoin on full time is that you need to invest time and money to learn and gain enough experience of how the market moves because there will certainly be up and down movement which is both profitable depending on your understanding and positioning as a trader.\n\nJust like with any other skills you will learn or any job you will work at, there's a need to invest enough time into gathering the right knowledge and experience so you can understand the market. There's certainly money in the Bitcoin market, billions of it are being traded daily and a large part of that goes as profit to the hands of people that have the experience and understand how to analyze and trade.\n\nA lot of youths will save their self and family from poverty if they can invest into learning this viable skill and with a continuous gathering of experience by trading frequently they can make enough money and also become trading experts in the process.\nThe risks are there as well, but it is just like any other business and even in Bitcoin Trading, the profit or gain potential far outweigh the risk, that's why we can take it as a long term business and invest our time and money and it pays.\nIf you like to learn this and invest, kindly DM Me.", "author": "_toray_fx"}, {"comment": "Awesome lovers üíìüíñüíù you can come to my DM if you wanna talk to me and I promise to respond well .", "author": "cainsusanpea"}, {"comment": "I have been suffering from herpes over 3 years of my marriage and it was really difficult and heartbreaking for me because the symptoms were very terrible and difficult for me, i search for cure, went to different hospital but still no hope until i saw a testimonies of someone who cure of herpes by Dr odgman i took the chance to contact the Dr odgman who have the natural cure to herpes, he assure me of his herbal medication which i listen to his advice and i bought his herbal medication and i used it as instructed by the Dr odgman, in a month time i went to the hospital for scan and they confirm that there is no trace or sign of herpes in me and now am happy and gladly with my family. contact Dr odgman for more information and advice . kindly contact him on WhatsApp +2349036525734 or through via email address dr odgman253@gmail.com", "author": "jenffery_jane"}]}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BroEiwQls0J/", "caption": "‚úèÔ∏èGary Varvel, @indystar\n#legalization #marijuana #drugs #pot #legalize", "comments": [{"comment": "Whoaaaa awaken üóΩüôå", "author": "j1_pvx"}, {"comment": "Finally patients will receive the benefits of less pain.", "author": "wltrmelnyk15"}]}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/5asRZolTlI/", "caption": "For more laughs about the hack of Ashley Madison, a dating website for people who are married, watch Punchlines: http://usat.ly/1GzcBvv #JamesCorden, #JimmyFallon, #SethMeyers, #laughs, #jokes, #AshleyMadison, #onlinedating, #hack, #databreach"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3rbcdEAwYD/", "caption": "Marc Murphy, (Louisville, Ky.)
