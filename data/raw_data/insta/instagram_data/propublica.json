Several department employees had arranged for Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, to be sworn into an influential Pentagon advisory board despite the fact that, in the year since he‚Äôd been nominated, Bezos had never completed a required background check to obtain a security clearance.\n\nMattis was about to fly to the West Coast, where he would personally swear Bezos in at Amazon‚Äôs headquarters before moving on to meetings with executives from Google and Apple. Soon phone calls and emails began bouncing around the Pentagon. Security clearances are no trivial matter to defense officials; they exist to ensure that people with access to sensitive information aren‚Äôt, say, vulnerable to blackmail and don‚Äôt have conflicts of interest. Laster also contended that it was a ‚Äúnoteworthy exception‚Äù for Mattis to perform the ceremony. Secretaries of defense, she wrote, don‚Äôt hold swearing-in events.\n\nLaster‚Äôs alarms triggered fear among Pentagon brass that Mattis would be seen as doing a special favor for Bezos, which could put him in hot water with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly proclaimed his antipathy to Bezos, mainly because of his ownership of The Washington Post. The swearing-in was canceled only hours before it was scheduled to occur. (This episode, never previously reported, is based on interviews with six people familiar with the matter. An Amazon spokesperson said the company was told that Bezos did not need a security clearance and that the company provided all requested information.) Laster did her best to enforce the rules. She would challenge the Pentagon‚Äôs cozy relationship not only with Bezos, but with Google‚Äôs Eric Schmidt, the chairman of the defense board that Bezos sought to join. The ultimate resolution? Laster was shunted aside.

And many people who work with immigrants, including social service providers and local and state governments, are worried that it will scare them away from using benefits they and their families need to thrive.\n\nTo soften the blow, the rule contains a few exceptions ‚Äî groups of immigrants who are allowed to use public benefits without jeopardizing their future immigration status. But the rule is so sloppily written that it ended up treating immigrants who are married to U.S. citizens more harshly than immigrants married to noncitizens.\n\nActive-duty service members who are immigrant noncitizens are allowed to use benefits without having it weigh against them as a ‚Äúpublic charge‚Äù in the future. So are the family members of active-duty immigrant service members. But immigrants who are the spouses or children of active-duty service members who are U.S. citizens are not included in the exception, meaning their use of benefits while their spouses were on active duty could jeopardize their future in the U.S. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sloppy drafting.

An additional $4.5 million will support 20 officer positions and be provided to Alaska Native organizations by the end of July.\n\nThe announcement follows an investigation by the Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica, which found that one in three communities in Alaska, about 70 altogether and nearly all of them Alaska Native, had no local law enforcement at some point this year.

Nor did they reflect the risk that the chicks could show up sick or dead, or that the company could simply stop delivering flocks. \nThe shadow of slavery, sharecropping and Jim Crow has left black farmers in an especially precarious position. While white farmers benefited from government assistance such as the Homestead Act and land-grant universities, black farmers were largely excluded from owning land and accumulating wealth.

A few large companies dominate the market, and they pretty much call the shots for the farmers ‚Äî from birds to feed to pricing. \nChicken companies contract with local farmers to raise and care for birds for several weeks until they‚Äôre ready for slaughter. The farmers bear the cost of housing the birds, equipment and fuel. The companies, in addition to delivering chicks and feed, rank the farmers based on how plump their birds get and pay accordingly. This so-called ‚Äútournament system‚Äù rewards the most efficient producers, the companies argue, but farmers say the companies control key variables, such as who receives the healthiest chicks and the most nutritious feed, and, thus, who comes out on top.\n\nOne clear indicator of companies‚Äô growing leverage over farmers: Farmers‚Äô average pay rose by just 2.5 cents a pound from 1988 to 2016, while the wholesale price of chicken increased by 17.4 cents a pound, data from the USDA and the National Chicken Council shows. \nThe main law regulating meatpackers was passed almost a century ago after a Federal Trade Commission investigation found that five companies had a stranglehold over the country‚Äôs meat supply and used it to fix prices, crush competition and defraud farmers and consumers.\n\nThe Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 prohibited meatpackers from engaging in unfair and deceptive practices, manipulating prices, creating monopolies or giving undue preference to particular people, businesses or places. The law‚Äôs scope expanded over the next several decades to apply to livestock dealers, live poultry dealers, swine contractors and other related businesses.\n\nEventually, however, courts, the Justice Department, the FTC and the USDA softened their stance on consolidation.

According to data released by the IRS last week, millionaires in 2018 were about 80% less likely to be audited than they were in 2011.\n\nBut poor taxpayers continue to bear the brunt of the IRS‚Äô remaining force.

Last year, the top 1% of taxpayers by income were audited at a rate of 1.56%. EITC recipients, who typically have annual income under $20,000, were audited at 1.41%. Part of the reason is ease. Audits of EITC recipients are largely automated and far less complicated. ‚ÄúWhile the wealthy now have an open invitation to cheat, low-income taxpayers are receiving heightened scrutiny because they can be audited far more easily.

Invisible walls created by local zoning boards and the state government block affordable housing and, by extension, the people who need it.\n\nAn investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica has found that more than three dozen Connecticut towns have blocked construction of any privately developed duplexes and apartments within their borders for the last two decades, often through exclusionary zoning requirements. In 18 of those towns, it‚Äôs been at least 28 years.\n\nIn Westport ‚Äî where gated residences overlook the Long Island Sound and voters solidly backed Democrats in the most recent state and presidential elections ‚Äî private developers have been allowed to open just 65 affordable housing units over the last three decades. Public housing rentals operated by the local housing authority have also grown at a snail‚Äôs pace, with 71 new units opening in this charming small town of 10,400 homes.\n\nThe impact of this logjam on families is that the share of housing specifically dedicated for low-income residents has actually decreased by small percentages in one-quarter of Connecticut‚Äôs municipalities since 1990. \nAshana Cunningham, a 33-year-old mother of three, lives 9 miles from Westport‚Äôs posh downtown. \nEach workday, she takes a bus from a homeless shelter in Bridgeport, where she lives with her family among a landscape of abandoned factories, run-down houses and trash-lined streets to her job in a suburban cornucopia a few miles away.

A local sex offender, Edmond Morris, pried open a window, tore the clothes from a village elder‚Äôs daughter, gripped her throat, and raped her, according to charges against him in state court, which he denies.\n\nIn remote western Alaska, sex crime rates are double the statewide average.

Because of this injustice, when Smith was wrongfully convicted of another shooting, he reluctantly took a special plea deal that allowed him to maintain his innocence and be released, while the felony conviction was left on his record. .\nProPublica documented the consequences of this bad deal, called an Alford plea, telling the story of Demetrius and other defendants.

He made a request to revise his Alford plea and clear his record, but the prosecutor vetoed the request.\n.\nWeeks after ProPublica‚Äôs story, the prosecutor admitted he‚Äôd been wrong and asked a judge to schedule a new hearing.
