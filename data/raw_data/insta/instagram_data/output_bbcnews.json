I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS five years ago, i went to many hospitals for cure but there was no solution, so I was thinking how can I get a solution out so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution. so a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS and gave me his email, so i mail him. He told me all the things I need to do and also give me instructions to take, which I followed properly. Before I knew what is happening after two weeks the HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS that was in my body got vanished . so if you are also heart broken and also need a help, you can also email him at {dr.ogbeniherbalhome@gmail.com Contact him today on whatsapp number +2347031574707 and you will have a testimony...

Yet, in the 80s we welcomed with open arms millions of Palestinian refugees. And again, recently we welcome millions of Syrian refugees. All in the name of democracy advertised by your government officials. Your hypocrisy is astonishing yet not surprising. In a time when your broadcasting station could play a vital role in providing a voice to those who are unheard, you actually manage to add fuel to the fire.
