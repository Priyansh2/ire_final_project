Known as Tengerism, in which shamans channel ancestral spirits, it is widely regarded as Mongolia's national religion and part of its indigenous identity. Shamans, it is believed, are chosen by their ancestral spirits to serve as a bridge to the living world; a conduit to provide healing, knowledge, and advice. \nMongolia shamanism emerged from the grasslands thousands of years before Chinggis Khan founded the Mongol empire, and has evolved with rituals in worship of nature and 'the eternal blue sky.' Modern-day shamans are more typically consulted for advice in business deals, illness, or personal difficulties. Shamans employ tools, including headdresses and mouth harps, to induce trances for the spirits to 'use' their bodies and voices. While there are no official numbers, it is believed there are over 10,000 shamans in Mongolia, and many have formed unions, organizations, and collectives.\n\nSee more of the best photos from around the world each week at FT.com/week-in-pictures üì∑: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\n#FT #financialtimes #photooftheday #picoftheday #photo #photography #photographer \n#onassignment #mongolia #china #shaman #religion #solstice #summer #shamanism #sky #fire #asia #religious #ceremony #Ulaanbaatar #summersolstice", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/798a960d167de600d934c5f3579061a7/5E61F4EC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c81.0.918.918a/s640x640/36149255_480092222412596_491353973878423552_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BknQ4WBg3sD/", "caption": "FT Photo Diary üì∏: Loving the World Cup?
