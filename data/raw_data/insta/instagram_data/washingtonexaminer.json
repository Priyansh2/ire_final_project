San Francisco, New York, and Washington, DC. have banned straws in an effort to limit plastic waste in the oceans.\n\nA question seldom asked let alone answered is what impact, if any, will this have on ocean pollution as a whole?\n\nThe numbers show it will be negligible at best. \nA study estimated that approximately 8.75 million metric tons (MMT) of plastic waste enter the world’s oceans every year. Out of that, the US contributes less than 0.9%. Of the US total, only .004% comes from plastic straws.\n\nThat means that plastic straws from the US comprise only 0.00003% of the TOTAL plastic waste in the oceans.\n\nTo get to the heart of why so much plastic is in the ocean, one must only look East. Asian countries make up the top contributors with 71.1% of the world's plastic ocean waste coming from them, of which China is the largest contributor.\n\nAccording to a 2015 study, the US only contributes an average of 80,000 metric tons of plastic ocean waste, of which only 3 metric tons are straws.\n\nNOTES:\n- Scientists estimate roughly 7.5 million straws lay on America’s shorelines. At .4g each, that total equals 3 metric tons. http://bit.ly/30byHea - The 8.75 MMTs is the average of a range in a 2015 study of plastic in the ocean.

It is likely to remain so for long after the shutdown ends and government work resumes.⠀\n⠀\n#trump #wall #shutdown #pelosi #schumer #democrats #border #security #funding", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0e2cdf7e5319e95793ac7b5756255a4c/5E467C87/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.135.1080.1080a/s640x640/50612702_634263616991364_8712304823025409745_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs9LPI7AgBc/", "caption": "HAPPY 14TH ANNIVERSARY to President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump!
