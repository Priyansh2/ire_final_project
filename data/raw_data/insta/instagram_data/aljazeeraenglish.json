Later they took a group of men at gunpoint in a classroom on the first floor, shot them and threw their bodies out of the window.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nThe attackers - members of a Chechen separatist group called Riyad as-Saliheen Martyrs‚Äô Brigade - demanded the recognition of Chechnya‚Äôs independence from Russia and the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from the region.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nOn the third day of the standoff, local authorities received permission from the attackers to remove the bodies lying in front of the school. But when medical workers approached the building, two of them were shot dead, followed by two explosions 20 seconds later.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nThe siege ended with 334 hostages dead, more than half of whom were children.

Palestinian thobes are known for their red embroidered patterns. However, each city in historical Palestine traditionally has its own unique style.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nWomen sometimes used the environment as inspiration when embroidering their Thobes. For example, in the Jaffa area, which is known for its oranges and citrus fruits, women embroidered orange blossom on their Thobe.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nPalestinians have been speaking out against ‚Äúcultural appropriation‚Äù and the aim of the Heritage Day is to remind Palestinians of their rich heritage and the importance to maintain it.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nLast year, US Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib honoured her Palestinian heritage by wearing a traditional thobe at the US Congress swearing-in ceremony. üîó Find this story in the link in our bio.‚Å† üîó\n.‚Å†\n#palestinian #thobe #heritage #fashion #dress #woman #pride #pattern‚Å†\n.‚Å†\n| üì∑ Photos: Jonathan Ernst, Raneen Sawafta, Mohamad Torokman, @reuters / Alaa Badarneh, @epaphotos |", "img_url": "https://instagram.fhyd2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/efb6bc236c946dc50292cacbfe864d47/5E4BDD70/t51.2885-15/e35/c243.0.594.594a/66010776_672080976593225_7594572157576906599_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fhyd2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0VlSsHno98/", "caption": "BREAKING: Tunisia‚Äôs 92-year-old president, Beji Caid Essebsi, has died at the Tunis military hospital, the office of the presidency announced on Thursday.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nThe 92-year-old was hospitalised with a severe illness in late June, but returned to intensive care on Thursday.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nEssebsi, the country's first democratically elected president, came to power in 2014, three years after the Arab Spring uprising toppled longtime despot Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and sparked revolts in several Arab nations.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nHe was the founder and chairman of the secularist Nidaa Tounes (Call of Tunis) party.‚Å†\n.‚Å†\nWhat are your memories of the late president and his time in power?

The car went up in flames, and it took 55 seconds to pull him out of the car. At the hospital, a priest gave him the last rites, in light of his serious burns and a damaged lung.\n.\n\"But I did not want to die. I wanted to go on living,\" Lauda said.\n.\nJust 42 days after the crash, Lauda was again behind the wheel and took fourth place in the Italian Grand Prix in Monza, ending the championship season as runner-up to British rival James Hunt.\n.\nEven more remarkably, he went on to become world champion two more times, in 1977 and 1984, following his first Formula One title in 1975.\n.\nHe became an entrepreneur and launched Lauda Air in 1979. In May 1991, one of his aircraft crashed after takeoff from Bangkok. All 223 passengers and crew members died.\n.\nHe sold the airline and other businesses after that and returned in F1 as an adviser for the Ferrari race team, before becoming the non-executive chairman of the Mercedes F1 team in 2012.\n.\n#Lauda #NikiLauda #f1 #formula1 #ferrari #mercedes #CiaoNiki #RIPNiki\n.\n| üì∑ Photos: Manu Fernandez, Hans Peter Hill, Jeff Widener, @apnews / Frank Barratt, Keystone - Fox Photos, Hulton Archive, @gettyimages / Laszlo Balogh, Pablo Sanchez, @reuters |", "img_url": "https://instagram.fhyd2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/432592b30e3232ae8d36186cf3998cc5/5E5B8D72/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c303.0.832.832a/s640x640/59418073_2028831337227990_1829271999167293926_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fhyd2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxsCtV4lfPe/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fhyd2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d1669fd2c6541f86a1705e2aa384e928/5DBE3090/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.90.720.720a/s640x640/59396984_2033299200126828_1300231960909071000_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fhyd2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxrdTq8FmyE/", "caption": "Did you watch the Game of Thrones finale last night?\n.\nLots of fans around the world made plans to watch the last episode of the epic HBO series together.
