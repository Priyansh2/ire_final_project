Images by @lynseyaddario | Lynsey Addario\n1. Lynsey Addario's coverage of maternal mortality took her to a remote village in Badakhshan province, Afghanistan in 2009, where she photographed a midwife giving a prenatal check in a private home. \"In these areas someone will announce that a doctor and a midwife are coming, and any pregnant and lactating women within a certain radius come if they want prenatal or postnatal care,\" she says.\n 2. Addario recalls visiting Tezpur Civil Hospital in Assam, India, \"where there's tea plantations all around. In that area I was looking at the conditions for women, and you can tell that [the hospital] is grossly overcrowded. There were women waiting to deliver, some had already delivered — there were even women sleeping in the hallways of this hospital on the stairs leading up to the main ward.\" 3. \"This is a fistula repair in Kabul, Afghanistan, with two surgeries going on side by side,\" Addario says. \"A fistula is a tear, often between the vagina and the anus. It's common in many countries with child marriage, or where women have birth very young. It's quite a shame — often women are shunned from their houses or don't get care — there's often a smell associated with fistula.\" 4. \"This is part of Dr. Edna Ismail's team doing outreach in a remote village in Somaliland,\" Addario says. \"They do a similar thing like in Afghanistan, where they make an announcement for any pregnant and lactating women to come for a prenatal check. That's essentially the only way women can get care unless they walk or are able to get transport to the nearest hospital or clinic.\"\n5. A mother receives postnatal care in a Somaliland hospital. \"She was brought [there] in a wheelbarrow,\" Addario recalls. \"She delivered her baby stillborn then started hemorrhaging. It was extraordinary for me to witness — it was very similar to what I'd seen a decade earlier when Mamma Sessay died but in this case the woman survived because there were trained midwives who knew exactly what to do.\"", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/210078ea39678bf05c7dc9fc3deff911/5E4F1762/t51.2885-15/e35/c145.0.574.574a/72490291_166085081249188_6652826043337685838_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B35QEjQgnEA/", "caption": "We all want our kids to reach their full potential, but that doesn't mean running math drills.

And it likely involved their families. The pressure to send kids to college, coupled with the realities of tuition, has fundamentally changed the experience of being middle class in America, says Caitlin Zaloom, an anthropologist and associate professor at New York University. It's changed the way that middle class parents raise their children, she adds, and shaped family dynamics along the way. Zaloom interviewed dozens of families taking out student loans for her new book, Indebted: How Families Make College Work at Any Cost. She defines those families as middle class because they make too much to qualify for federal aid — but too little to pay the full cost of a degree at most colleges. For many, the burden of student debt raises big questions about what a degree is for.

Sometimes it's cheaper for packagers to make things out of raw, virgin plastic than it is to buy the recycled kind. In 2018, China stopped taking most plastic waste from the U.S. So now the whole plastics industrial chain -- from the oil industry to recyclers -- is under pressure to figure out what to do with that waste. Recycling alone can’t solve the problem, but it does capture a percentage of this material. And many believe it’s a vital piece of an overall waste strategy which includes reducing and replacing disposables with reusable materials. To help, recyclers say we should be putting more of the right kinds of plastic into the recycling bin.

Cole, professor emeritus of African art history at University of California, Santa Barbara, allows the wearer to truly say: \"I am not myself.\"\nFor more than 30 years, Phyllis Galembo has been fascinated by masks and costumes and photographed them in countries from Benin to Zambia. Most recently, she has turned her lens on Mexico. Her newly published book Mexico Masks/Rituals (Radius Books/D.A.P.) restores the mask — and the political, cultural, religious and social messages it can telegraph — from tourist commodity to its role as an artifact of ritual and celebration.

This costume, with corn husks and feathers and paper flowers, is worn by a member of a dance group that gathers in cemeteries and other places to mark Day of the Dead festivities (called Xantolo, the word written above the mask). The idea of combining a skeletal mask with European fashion was devised by the Mexican artist Jose Guadalupe Posada, who lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n2. In the mountainous Sierra Norte region, northeast of Mexico City, the year-end festival of la Virgen de Guadalupe is considered the most significant community ritual.

The visit showed how things changed dramatically for retirees in just one generation. \nHer classmate Pete Nicolaou worked at Youngstown Sheet & Tube mill after graduation in 1973. Four years later the company shut down and instantly wiped out 5,000 jobs. Nicolaou went on to work at a van plant — until that closed down — and then on to an auto plant. But the hard, physical work wrecked his knees and triggered other health problems. He had to retire at 56. Nicolaou’s story is not uncommon for blue-collar baby boomers. Arthritis, diabetes, heart troubles, cancer and more — they make it impossible to work.\n\nToday, the rate of people 65 and older filing for bankruptcy is triple what it was in 1991, according to the Consumer Bankruptcy Project. Here's the cruel irony: Affluence is accelerating for retirees who had made it into the higher ranks of earners, such as business managers, doctors, accountants, lawyers — and even journalists at big news outlets. \nFollow the link in our bio for the full story.

White House chief of staff Reince Priebus made sure the allusion to the 40th president was clear. \"Some of the core principles of President Trump are very similar to those of Ronald Reagan,\" the former Republican National Committee chairman told CPAC attendees on Thursday. \"When you look at peace through strength and building up the military ... Peace through strength, deregulation. You think about the economy, the economic boom that was created. And some of it is going to take a little time, I mean, to get the jobs back; to get more money in people's pockets. Those things are going to happen.\" But Trump's proclamation on Friday that \"the era of empty talk is over\" belies the struggles he's had in his first month in office — from blowback over the hurried implementation of his controversial travel ban to the anger Republican members of Congress are facing back home at recess town halls this week without a replacement plan if Obamacare is repealed.\n\nAbove: Scenes from CPAC 2017 at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in Maryland.

But are they legitimizing a slur, engaging in appropriation, or just making an old word new? Several scholars say it's a misconception that hapa has derogatory roots. The word entered the Hawaiian language in the early 1800s, with the arrival of Christian missionaries who instituted a Hawaiian alphabet and developed curriculum for schools. Hapa is a transliteration of the English word \"half,\" but quickly came to mean \"part,\" combining with numbers to make fractions. Hapa haole — part foreigner — came to mean a mix of Hawaiian and other, whether describing a mixed-race person, a fusion song, a bilingual Bible, or pidgin language itself. However, some Hawaiians say the widespread use of hapa is a form of cultural appropriation, just as offensive as hula dancer dolls shaking their hips on car dashboards.

No parent, teacher or caregiver has the time or patience to respond perfectly to all of the many, many, many opportunities like these that come along. But a new book, 'Becoming Brilliant: What Science Tells Us About Raising Successful Children,' is designed to get us thinking about the magnitude of these moments. // “We're training kids to do what computers do, which is spit back facts. And computers are always going to be better than human beings at that,” says Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, co-author of the book. “But what they're not going to be better at is being social, navigating relationships, being citizens in a community.

They held press conferences and slept overnight in lawn chairs. Everyone had come to make the same point: They'd made it through Superstorm Sandy, which hit the shores of New Jersey and New York in October 2012. But three years later, many hadn't made it home. Superstorm Sandy wasn't a disaster for everyone, though. For some, it was big money.\n\nNPR and the PBS series Frontline have spent the past year investigating the business of disaster and have uncovered a complex system in which private companies profit and homeowners and clients suffer. At the center of that system is the National Flood Insurance Program, which is designed to help in disasters like Sandy. Almost everyone with a mortgage who lives near water pays for flood insurance through the program, so more than three years later most residents expected to be home. But in many cases that didn't happen. While thousands of homeowners like Doug Quinn, a 51-year-old from Toms River, N.J. said they have not received the recovery help they need, the investigation found that their private insurance companies that administer the government's flood program made as much as an estimated $240 million to $406 million in profit annually over the past four years.

In his newest book, ‘Service’, the British-born photographer turns his lens on U.S. military personnel and their loved ones. \"I had done so many portraits of leaders,\" he says. \"And what is great leadership? We have seen it being about confidence, charisma, strength, decision making. We all know that side. But there's another side that's far more complicated – that's the idea of service. I wanted to find out what happens when you're asked to do something and you do it – and it's very dangerous, and the sacrifices you make. This is where I learned about the other side of leadership, which is service.” In the waning weeks of the 2008 presidential campaign, the New Yorker published several of Platon's images.

The town of about 5,000 people became home to one of the biggest HIV outbreaks in decades, with more than 140 diagnosed cases. At the root of the outbreak was a powerful prescription painkiller called Opana. The drug, which was at the center of Indiana’s HIV outbreak in 2015, was reformulated to deter abuse, but users began injecting it to get high. When news of the HIV infections broke, Kevin Polly was one of the few people in Austin willing to go on the record and say he was using Opana. Polly had contracted HIV, and at the time told a CBS reporter he had no plans to quit injecting the drug.\n\nClyde Polly, Kevin's 73-year-old father (seen here), says his son went to a rehab facility and isn't living in Clyde's one-story brick house anymore. Even though Kevin is gone, Clyde says some of his son's friends who do drugs are still there. Not all of them are HIV positive, and not everyone is from Austin — but most of them are using Opana. \"Everyone that's in there right now has probably done it,\" he says. \"There's about a half-dozen in there.

It engaged millions who might have ignored the film after the prequels disappeared into the sarlacc pit of critical disdain. It brought a shine to the eyes of children who'd never seen their reflections in a story so grand and sweeping. And it led already addicted fans to talk and think differently about the franchise they love. But, of course, change has not been welcomed by all. Among those who see the whiteness and maleness of heroes as a divine right, these casting choices triggered some of the more virulent social media reactions of recent memory, a great disturbance rippling out to the farthest reaches of pop culture.\n\nThis battle between factions — those accepting \"darkness\" in their onscreen heroes (and, with it, openness, change and progress), and those stubbornly clinging to \"lightness\" (and thus psychic closure, defiant self-delusion and often plain-and-simple racism) — played out multiple times throughout 2015, as other \"nontraditional\" casting choices sparked similar backlash from the uglier crevices of the Internet.

But we're not hearing from the people who will be most affected by the court's decision: college-bound teenagers.\n\nNPR talked to teenagers who attend two suburban high schools near Washington, D.C.: One is majority black, and the other school has a mix of Latino, black, white and Asian students. The 16- and 17-year-olds knew little or nothing about the case that's before the Supreme Court — Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin — or about Abigail Fisher, the young woman who sued the university back in 2008. Fisher was denied admission because, she argued, the university wanted more minorities and she was white.\n\nSo here's the question we asked the students: Should college admissions decisions take race into consideration?\n\nAnh-Thi Le, 17, is Vietnamese-American and a senior at Northwood High School, one of the most racially diverse schools in Montgomery County, Md. Anh-Thi is applying to Georgetown University and other top schools where Asians are overrepresented. Even though, says Anh-Thi, Asian kids from poor immigrant families like hers face the same daunting odds that poor black and Latino students face. \"They weren't given as much guidance when it comes to college. They don't have the same resources like expensive SAT [prep] classes or educated parents who can teach them how to get into college. So, they have to work a lot harder than a white student. I don't think that's fair,\" Anh-Thi says.\n\nListen to other students talk about affirmative action via the link in our profile.

While much of the country watched these events unfold, they had the deepest resonance in the cities at the center of them — going beyond the news and filtering into into family living rooms and kitchens.\n\nThat's true of Liz Alston's family in Charleston, S.C. It's a family that is deeply political — all of them have voted in every presidential election they could. But, this campaign season, the political disagreements aren't necessarily about a specific presidential candidate, but, rather, a specific issue – the rise of protests around issues of race and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nNPR spent the afternoon with some of Alston's relatives, as they often do, discussing politics, race, power, and protests at her home in the historic neighborhood of Old Charleston. The conversation began with presidential politics, and quickly veered toward the protesters who interrupted a Clinton campaign event in October at a historically black college in Atlanta.\n\nHere, LaCurtia Brown, 22, embraces Judge Richard Fields, 95, who’s affectionately known as \"The Judge\" to his family. LaCurtia has never attended a protest rally herself, but she agrees with the activists and understands why they're targeting Clinton now. \"I think protesting is harmless. I think that they just want a voice, they want to be heard,” she said.\n\nListen to the entire conversation via the link in our profile.

The researchers gave a small group of boys, ages 8 to 12, a sequence of random letters and numbers. Their job: Repeat back the numbers in order, plus the last letter in the bunch. All the while, the kids were sitting in a swiveling chair.

Here's why she holds onto all of them: \n1)A bar of Fels-Naptha soap. Because it was my mother’s favorite. She died of cancer when I was 30. Usually it’s little stuff that brings her back.\n\n2) An anonymous booking photograph. Because behind every person is something sparkly and magnificent, a story waiting to be told. I work in journalism and see it first hand, over and over.\n\n3) A roll of twine. Because life is, for the most part, maddeningly messy, I vacillate between wanting to stuff it all into pretty little boxes and realizing it’s just not possible. \n4) A cigarette. Because sometimes I sneak them. My dirty, shameful little secret.  Exposed.\n\n5) A number sign. Although this No. means number, for me it will always mean: No. Period. Because my life is marked by moments that stand in defiance of that word.\n\n6) An old snapshot holder. It’s empty. Which means it's full of possibility. Because as a photojournalist, it’s not about the pictures you've taken, but the ones you’ve yet to make.\n\n7) Home Sweet Home, cross-stitched and framed. I made it when I longed for such things.

Public Square is a community storytelling project through @Instagram. Each month, we'll ask you to share a glimpse of your life or the world around you through an image or video.\n\nOur first theme is Hard Work. Your goal is to find someone with a thankless job and thank them. We're inspired by protests among fast food workers across the country seeking pay raises. Seek out a person who makes your burger, drives your bus, checks your luggage, cleans the street or delivers your mail.\n\nTake their portrait or capture an image of them at work. Ask them their name and their story. Write a short note about your subject in the caption.\n\nHere's where Public Square differs from other Instagram challenges. We're public radio, and storytelling is in our DNA. For this project, your caption is always just as important as the image above it. @edkashi took this photo in Montclair, N.J.
