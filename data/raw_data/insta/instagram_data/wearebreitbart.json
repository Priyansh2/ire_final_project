Most attendants do not know the price, and those who are empty-handed just get waved through having paid nothing at all. ‚ÄúYou can pay with a cigarette,‚Äù Orlando Molina, told the agency while filling up his subcompact Ford Ka in Caracas. ‚ÄúHeck, it‚Äôs no secret to anyone that it goes for nothing.‚Äù The government has long subsidized gasoline since Hugo Ch√°vez came to power in 1998 as an integral part of his socialist revolution. Yet despite the stratospheric levels of hyperinflation, the Maduro regime has refused to raise prices, meaning that the cost of filling up a tank is equivalent to just a fraction of a cent. One Caracas resident, identified as Mar√≠a P√©rez, told the agency that many customers would happily pay more for gas if the government would use the proceeds to invest in improving road safety. ‚ÄúOur roads are unbearable,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúThere are huge holes ‚Äî craters ‚Äî that not only damage our cars but also put our own lives at risk.‚Äù Maduro has acknowledged that the state-run oil company Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA) runs a deficit of billion dollars a year because of the enormous discrepancy between the cost of gasoline and the costs of production.\n\nThe low cost of fuel is helped by the fact that Venezuela sits upon the world‚Äôs largest oil reserves, although that has not prevented widespread shortages of gasoline, with oil production last year falling to under one million barrels a day, a thirty-year low.

Back in 2013-2014, the White House put Biden in charge of Ukraine and a number of specific issues regarding the Chinese government. Riding his father‚Äôs coattails, and without any experience with either Ukraine or in the energy sector, Hunter secured a seat on the board of Burisma, where he was paid an incredible $50,000 a month ‚Äî a month! ‚Äî to the eventual tune of, according to some reports, three million dollars. In China, Hunter literally hitched a ride on Air Force Two with his dad to Beijing and secured a $1.5 billion ‚Äî with a ‚ÄúB‚Äù ‚Äî deal that could, according to FactCheck.org, eventually earn him tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnd what has been the real-world result of what stinks like a couple of foreign bribes‚Ä¶? Well, we have Joe Biden on video bragging about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, a prosecutor who, under penalty of perjury, says he was investigating Burisma. To get this prosecutor fired, Biden admits to muscling Ukraine‚Äôs government into a quid pro quo: no U.S. aid unless you fire the guy.\n\nUkraine fired the guy. And then there‚Äôs Joe Biden‚Äôs sucking up to the same Chinese government that ‚Äî through the Bank of China ‚Äî handed a company in which Hunter has a ten percent stake in a cool $1.5 billion.\n\nWhen confronted with these obvious and utterly shameless conflicts of interest, the media allow Biden to hide behind his outrage over his integrity being challenged coupled with his now-debunked lie about never having discussed these shady overseas business deals with Hunter.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b303678ffa9e20e0e0db5dd554a21caf/5E400CE6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.118.1440.1440a/s640x640/71243489_505145873671937_5948701418567405344_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3sE6yJHEXy/", "caption": "Expectations for real incomes among the American public hit the highest level that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has ever tracked in its monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations.\n\nThe central bank said that in September expectations for inflation one year ahead rose slightly to 2.48 percent from 2.41 percent a month earlier. At the same time, expectations for earnings jumped to 2.54 percent from 2.26 percent. As a result, inflation-adjusted earnings expectations turned positive, rising to 0.06 percent. That might not seem like a huge positive but it is a record high in a metric that rarely even registers a figure above zero. Typically, the public‚Äôs expectations for inflation have outpaced expectations for earnings gains, suggesting the public expects to lose ground after price increases. The only two positive, non-zero readings on this measure were June and July of 2018, when the survey showed 0.05 percent expected real gains. The NY Fed‚Äôs survey data goes back to 2013.\n\nThe survey is constructed by asking the public where they expect their earnings to go if they kept the same job over the next year.\n\nAnother measure on the Fed survey asks about household income rather than individual earnings. This measure also hit a record high in inflation-adjusted terms, rising to a 0.45 percent improvement. This could provide support for consumer spending, a crucial force driving economic growth. Consumer expectations about household earnings can drive large purchases such as homes, cars, and major appliances.\n\nMany economic models of voter behavior also suggest that expectations for improving income can give a boost to incumbent candidates, suggesting that President Donald Trump may have a good chance of being re-elected. An analysis released recently by Moody‚Äôs said that Trump could easily beat his Democrat rivals even if the economy substantially deteriorates over the next year.

This indicates that about 226 illegal aliens claiming to be part of a family unit were deported every month last year compared to about 1,250 deported each month in August and September of this year ‚Äî a more than 453 percent increase in illegal family unit deportations based on monthly totals.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, research finds that deporting the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens saves American taxpayers billions compared to the costs they are forced to pay when illegal aliens are allowed to stay.\n\nDeporting every illegal alien in the country would amount to a cost savings of about $622 billion over the course of a lifetime.

The elder Biden had pushed the Ukrainian government to fire a former chief prosecutor, who had opened an investigation into the company‚Äôs CEO.\n\nThe Bidens have denied doing anything improper, and the former vice president has denied ever speaking to his son about his work, although conflicting accounts, including from his own son, have emerged, as well as a picture of him, his son, and a Ukrainian gas executive on a golfing trip together.\n\nThe younger Biden also had ties with an investment firm that raised funds in China. He once accompanied his father on a work trip to China and appeared to further those ties during that trip.\n\nThe poll surveyed 900 adults contacted via mobile phones and landlines from September 26 to October 3 and had a 3.3-point margin of error. The poll‚Äôs Ukraine-related questions reflect the views of a subset of 748 people.\n\nMeanwhile, the poll showed that Trump was not being significantly affected by Democrat calls to impeach him after a whistleblower complaint expressed concerns he was withholding military aid in exchange for help with the 2020 elections.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a6ef8c5d28ac16f1a3302f3b4e8287e6/5E43635F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.111.1433.1433a/s640x640/69896742_801130160289835_6654768149781202489_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3S9U9xnZ4J/", "caption": "üî¥ Swing voters turned off by core Democrat policies.

Unemployment was expected to remain unchanged at last month‚Äôs 3.7 percent. The jobs data for the two previous months were also revised upward, indicating that the labor market was stronger over the summer than previously indicated. Employment for July was revised up by 7,000 from 159,000 to 166,000, and August was revised up by 38,000 from 130,000 to 168,000. With these revisions, employment gains in July and August combined were 45,000 more than previously reported. The stronger numbers for July and August may also explain the slightly-below expectations figure for September since some of the growth in employment forecast for last month had already occurred. The last time the rate was this low was in December 1969, when it also was 3.5 percent.\n\nEconomic data has been intensely scrutinized this week for signs of economic sluggishness after the Institute for Supply Management‚Äôs survey of manufacturing companies suggested the manufacturing sector had unexpectedly contracted for a second consecutive month. Survey data of non-manufacturing companies, however, showed that the services sector continued to expand in September. Similarly, data on private payrolls and unemployment claims suggested that the U.S. economy had cooled but was not near a recession.\n\nSeptember‚Äôs hiring may have been weighed down by the strike by General Motors workers, which has sidelined GM plants and likely prevented GM suppliers from hiring new workers. The latest data suggests that manufacturing held its job count near steady, shedding just 2,000 jobs during the month. Wage growth was weak in the month. In September, average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls, at $28.09, were down 1 cent, after rising by 11 cents in August.

On December 4, 2013, Breitbart News reported a Congressional Research Service report showing the number of privately-owned guns jumped from 192 million firearms in 1994 to 310 million in 2009. The study showed that the ‚Äúfirearm-related murder and non-negligent homicide‚Äù fell sharply as the number of guns in private hands expanded.

Although the former vice president has attempted to paint the issue as an abuse of power on Trump‚Äôs part, many have noted the unanswered questions surrounding his son‚Äôs tenure at Burisma points to serious conflict of interests, if not outright corruption. The most prominent and perplexing question is how and why Hunter Biden was appointed to the company‚Äôs board of directors in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to current and past members of the company‚Äôs board of directors. At the time of his appointment, ethics watchdogs highlighted the younger Biden‚Äôs lack of qualifications but were more concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. In particular, many worried Hunter Biden‚Äôs ascension to the board of directors, a position that paid at times more than $83,000 per month, was related to his father‚Äôs position as the Obama administration‚Äôs point man on Ukraine.", "img_url":

alleged collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign ‚Äî collusion later found not to exist.\n\nThe demand, which came from U.S. Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), resurfaced Wednesday in an opinion piece written by conservative Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post. Ironically, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared Tuesday that the mere possibility that President Trump had asked Ukraine to continue an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden ‚Äî even without a quid pro quo ‚Äî was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry. (Biden boasted in 2018 that he had forced Ukraine to remove its prosecutor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid; he did not tell his audience at the Council on Foreign Relations that the prosecutor was looking into a firm on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was serving.) The Democrats‚Äô letter is available online. In it, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy demanded that the Ukrainian government answer their questions about the Mueller probe, and issued an implied threat: ‚ÄúThis reported refusal to cooperate with the Mueller probe also sends a worrying signal ‚Äî to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community ‚Äî about your government‚Äôs commitment more broadly to support justice and the rule of law.‚Äù", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/963d1e71a2515a05aa519f492c8360c2/5E63FF6D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.111.1433.1433a/s640x640/69482273_815646385518999_4785564847191118238_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B20O6gqnpPS/", "caption": "***BREAKING*** Ed Henry of Fox News reported Tuesday evening on Hannity that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General found that the so-called ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äù who raised concerns about President Donald Trump‚Äôs discussions with foreign leaders had a ‚Äúpolitical bias‚Äù in favor of one of Trump‚Äôs rivals in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe inspector general‚Äôs report has, thus far, been withheld by the administration.

How should we respond when our brothers and sisters are behaving badly?\n\nFor those of us who are Christian, our calling in life transcends our secular obligations. The secular world asks us to conform to a set of rules that are designed to preserve order and civil society. Regardless of any faith or ideology, a sort of mechanical obedience is required and indeed enforced by the rule of law.\n\nThings are not so simple on the Christian side. Here, the calling is greater and more comprehensive: we are bound by the example that Christ both lived and taught ‚Äî a bar so high in fact, that only the divine can achieve it. And still we are called to it anyways, a standard much higher than it is for simple, good citizenship. From Protestants to Catholics and Orthodox, we all share the belief that to  approach our daily lives rightly means we to ask ourselves: what would Jesus do? \nAnd perhaps nothing is as difficult, or painful, than to watch as the professing faithful behave incongruently with the teachings of Jesus.\n\nFull disclaimer: Jerry Falwell, Jr., has become a personal friend of mine over the past couple of years, and in May I received an honorary doctorate from Liberty at their commencement ceremony.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son‚Äôs role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son ‚Äî who enriched himself using his father‚Äôs prestige. It is not clear what law, if any, Trump would have broken by urging the Ukrainian government to re-open the case. The alleged ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äù in the case did not hear his conversations with Ukrainian leaders directly, and the Wall Street Journal has suggested there was no quid pro quo ‚Äî that Trump did not offer (or withhold) anything in return.\n\nNevertheless, the story has given new enthusiasm to supporters of impeachment in the House Democratic caucus, who had been somewhat deflated after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Russian collusion.\n\nIn July, the House voted 332-95 to postpone an impeachment resolution.

The students later reported the harassment to the school‚Äôs dean, in hopes that his behavior ‚Äúwill be corrected.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe reason why we had approached the dean,‚Äù said Beshay, ‚Äúis because that sort of behavior is really unacceptable, but it‚Äôs something we saw a lot of at that [recruiting] session ‚Äî we‚Äôve had a lot of people come up to us with conflicting opinions ‚Äî voicing them in a way that you would not [use] in an actual debate.‚Äù The students added that the individual in question ‚Äî along with two other professors ‚Äî maintain a blog, which they use to lambaste conservatives and Christians.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/29d6b0cdc4f112ed9ce152fcee06ba6e/5E48A993/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69629762_391435885067163_2682201375618351104_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ojERbnVay/", "caption": "#climatestrike #fridaysforfuture", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/019338c9d1f46e0f8de51d93a857a9b2/5E555F4A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69465887_487758471774201_110654118347043867_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ogMmAHrcU/", "caption": "üî•ü§£üî•ü§£üî•ü§£üî•", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c08222b521244004edb71e2cee9333f2/5E594267/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69042020_284075125884732_6291035316320059159_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oeikPHBVc/", "caption": "ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dd838e2c9385dec968354a4bd9dbfc07/5E654C92/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.33.1305.1305a/s640x640/69648167_431449254159989_8284719929694866380_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oXkZ-Hdz7/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bb140e451e1751aa09dc2bbef7db5c00/5E4CDD17/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69714513_390752081614558_681182150640830479_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2nhiJYHMel/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/26b850e07383db28b69fb51f17fd1488/5DC16A7B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/70122138_708511899560694_133287996092315364_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2nJGn9HNXS/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1f5ae5889fc1f545dcaa712f98583264/5E5BA34F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69481244_107354497196558_7950684234952580502_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2nHlOinnzs/", "caption": "Leftist activist Bette Midler @bettemidler announced her hopes that a ‚Äúbee hive‚Äù would fuck up President Donald Trump, and fantasized about Beyonce mobilizing to defeat Trump in 2020. ‚ÄúBeyonc√© has 133 million Instagram followers,‚Äù Bette Midler said. ‚ÄúMore than double the people who voted for Trump.

While the Democrat presidential candidates tailor their messages to the sensibilities of white uber-liberals, President Trump is running for re-election on a record of delivering unprecedented opportunity and prosperity to African-Americans.\n\nLeft-leaning commentators have begun to notice that the political views of white Democrats are now significantly to the left of the opinions held by the Party‚Äôs black voters on a wide range of topics. The Democratic Party has undergone a massive leftward lurch during the Trump era, but this embrace of far-left extremism has been driven almost exclusively by its far-left, mostly-white fringe. Black voters, who represent about a quarter of the entire Democrat electorate, are finding themselves increasingly out of step with a Party establishment that is rapidly abandoning traditional liberal values in favor of radical proposals that would completely upend American society. This is borne out by recent polling. Nearly 70 percent of black Democrats, for instance, insist that candidates must explain their plans to create jobs, compared to only 39 percent of white Democrats. When the Democrat presidential candidates mention job creation on the campaign trail, however, they usually do so as an afterthought, or else they cite grossly inflated projections of job creation in an effort to justify their plans to spend trillions of taxpayer dollars on big-government boondoggles, such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. That approach may be all it takes to satisfy most white liberals, but it gives short shrift to one of the primary concerns shared by a huge proportion of African American voters.\n\nSimilarly, 55 percent of black Democrats say they would only consider voting for candidates who propose plans to reduce taxes, compared to only 25 percent of white Democrats...Read the rest at Breitbart.com.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1ce67a29cf1bd6627b2fb1a09a757b3f/5E48FBFF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69784652_386557858705308_52151731561114885_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2kCKZlHTFY/", "caption": "üî∑Democrat Party activist Taylor Swift is ready to go all in for 2020.üî∑ Pop superstar and left-wing activist Taylor Swift @taylorswift has admitted to becoming ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with progressive politics and claims she is now ‚Äúreally focused‚Äù on helping Democrats defeat President Donald Trump and Republican candidates in the 2020 election cycle.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Swift spoke of how she has come to obsess over politics since her political adversaries have started winning elections. ‚ÄúI keep trying to learn as much as I can about politics, and it‚Äôs become something I‚Äôm now obsessed with, whereas before, I was living in this sort of political ambivalence because the person I voted for had always won,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúI think a lot of people are like me, where they just didn‚Äôt really know that this could happen.

What I talked about at our panel that was the plight of black immigrants was about the experience I was having as I went through the dungeons. There were stories that were being told, and I talked about how at that moment I had an image of what‚Äôs happening in Libya as- as people as- are being sold. We‚Äôve- we‚Äôve all seen that video, that auction of somebody being sold for 400 dollars. And then I talked about the separation stories that he told about how families were being torn apart, how children were being separated from their parents, how husband and wife would be forcibly separated. And I said that kind of reminded me of what was happening at our border here.\n\nBRENNAN: But you didn‚Äôt mean it as an attack on U.S. border agents?\n\nOMAR: Absolutely not. I think this is- this is always the point, right? There is always a- an implied intent to every conversation I have and if you listen to the video, one comparison of what the dungeons looked like and people being sold was to what‚Äôs happening in North Africa and the other one was a family separations.

A year ago, manufacturing businesses had 488,000 openings. The gains to manufacturing came entirely from durable goods jobs, which rose from 315,000 to 322,000. Nondurable openings ticked down from 193,000 to 191,000. The figures for manufacturing suggest that some of the concerns over the manufacturing sectors health may be overstated. As well, they indicate that tariffs are not playing a central role in the troubles of the sector\n\nWhen Trump announced that it would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, critics immediately said that while they might help steel and aluminum producers, they would be a net loser for America because metals-using manufacturing employs far more Americans than metals-producing. The higher price would cause employment in metals-using manufacturing to contract, the critics charged.\n\nThat has not happened. Job openings in durable goods have now expanded for five-months in a row. Hires soared 4.1 percent in July to 5.953 million. That indicates that some of the strain on the economy from the tight labor market may be easing, as employers are finding workers to fill open jobs.

The unemployment ratio has averaged around 2 to 1 or so for decades, meaning the black unemployment rate is typically twice the whtie unemployment rate.  In good times, the unemployment rate of whites and blacks falls but the gap remains. And in bad times, the unemployment rate for whites and black rises, but black unemployment typically remains around twice that of white employment. A year ago, the black unemployment rate stood at 6.6 percent while the white unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, meaning black unemployment was 185 percent of white unemployment. In August, the gap narrowed so that black unemployment was under 162 percent of white unemployment. That is the smallest gap ever in records going back to January 1972.\n\nThis is particularly remarkable because it comes at a time of remarkably low unemployment. Prior to the Trump era, the last time the gap fell below 170 percent was in August of 2009, when the black unemployment rate was 14.8 percent and the white unemployment rate was 8.9 percent. Back then the gap declined because white unemployment was increasing at a faster clip than the already sky-high black unemployment.\n\nIn other words, the decline in employment inequality now is undeniably the best on record because it comes in the context of falling unemployment.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/07677f11c49fad784f5f600254b62b9f/5E40A025/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69230295_133338237929366_7591065683918379348_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2EuHAEHnx-/", "caption": "üî∂BY: Allum Bokhariüî∂ Banning plastic straws.

This is the end result of the philosophy of the left today, that Mother Gaia, that the lowly squirrel is more important than human beings. We‚Äôre overpopulated, therefore we need to kill more of them.‚Äù Gorka highlighted Sanders‚Äôs framing of taxpayer funding for abortion as a humanitarian endeavor.

The media would do well to chill with mocking President Trump and instead learn some U.S. history. Our country‚Äôs desire to purchase Greenland predates the purchase of Alaska.... China understands that Greenland is strategically vital. Up there at the top of the world, it has a commanding position on the Arctic Ocean, not far from Russia.  I, and others, predict the Arctic Ocean will become a key international seaway, with an incalculable advantage going to Greenland.\n\nIt‚Äôs precisely because of Greenland‚Äôs strategic location that we put our northernmost military base there. The Thule Air Force base is crucial to our nation‚Äôs missile defense system. Again, is it any wonder why China is so eager to get a foothold in Greenland? As William Seward knew when he purchased Alaska from the Russians, controlling a strategic location allows the United States to establish a forward base and prevent our enemies from doing the same.\n\nSo, as a matter of national security as well as economic prosperity, it makes sense for the United States to have a strong footprint in Greenland.\n\nSo, go for it, Mr. President.

Fears of a recession, however, have been rising, with economists now saying that there is about a 35 percent chance the economy contracts next year. The yield curve briefly inverted last week, often a signal that a recession looms. According to the Washington Post, the talks are in their early stages. A cut to payroll taxes would have to be approved by Congress and could not be done by the White House alone. Americans employed by businesses pay a 6.2 percent ‚Äúpayroll tax‚Äù on their earnings, with their employers paying the same amount. Self-employed Americans pay a 12.4 percent tax. That tax is levied to finance Social Security. Americans also pay a Medicare payroll tax of 1.45 for employees and 1.45 for employers.\n\nIn an effort to stimulate the economy, Congress and the Obama administration temporarily cut the employee side of the Social Security payroll tax by two points in 2010. The Social Security trust funds were ‚Äúmade whole‚Äù for the lost payroll tax revenue by a transfer of general revenue, meaning the tax cut was financed through larger deficits.\n\nThat temporary cut was originally set to expire at the end of 2011 but was extended through 2013.\n\nA study by economists Christina Romer and David Romer found that tax cuts are effective at providing anti-recessionary economic stimulus. Payroll tax cuts work by immediately giving Americans a boost in take-home pay‚Äìat least some of which tends to be spent into the economy.\n\nVery low-interest rates on government bonds, particularly long-term Treasuries, may make a payroll tax cut even more attractive.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e8086ed47acd3398d7cf16f5843f9af7/5E63CA9D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.29.1298.1298a/s640x640/69173108_2419129621705125_6159692849123059378_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1XXYyFHwEa/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b519a36eeaa47800de0bd99c8b6a0dc3/5DC166C2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67802630_404635583782573_1905925178471509183_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1XEw0_H54y/", "caption": "üî∂Too little, too late?üî∑ Sen.

Doug Collins (R-GA) caught former Special Counsel Robert Mueller in a contradiction in his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning, noting that Mueller was saying something different now than he said in his report.\n\nDemocrats had hauled Mueller before the committee after the report found that there had been no collusion between any American and the Russian government in attempting to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, and failed to arrive at a conclusion about obstruction of justice. (Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined that there was insufficient basis for an obstruction of justice prosecution.) Dissatisfied with the outcome of the investigation, and with President Donald Trump‚Äôs repeated claims of exoneration, Democrats were eager to have Mueller testify directly. He agreed to do so but stated that he would not testify to anything that was different from his report. In his opening statement, Mueller stated: ‚ÄúWe did not address collusion, which is not a legal term. rather, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy, and it was not.‚Äù That statement suggested that the report had not, in fact, concluded that Trump had colluded with Russia ‚Äî contrary to what the president has said, and with common public understanding of the report.\n\nCollins began by asking Mueller whether ‚Äúcollusion‚Äù and ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù were synonymous. Mueller said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù However, Collins read Mueller‚Äôs own report to him: ‚ÄúOn page 180 of volume one of your report, you wrote, ‚ÄòAs defined in legal dictionaries, collusion is largely synonymous with conspiracy as that crime is set forth in the general federal conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. 371; ‚Ä¶ Are you sitting here today testifying something different than what your report states?‚Äù Mueller struggled to explain the contradiction, and ultimately admitted that the interpretation in his report was the correct one ‚Äî rather than the answer he had just given Congress.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0f46c6f4b21e54a1f63fe5e09c29ee8a/5E4834B6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.126.1440.1440a/s640x640/62235602_886814821695329_3688480686393457815_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0TKm5knjR_/", "caption": "ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c6f6d381fe6965b8b69693d93961dc50/5E55EC09/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67288530_2168638289932530_1354099724375933465_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0TGe27nf9c/", "caption": "üòÇüòÇThis is what we‚Äôll be wearing while watching today‚Äôs Mueller hearing in the House. 100% Made in the USA.

In fact, married couples with two children saved an average of $2,917 on their federal income taxes in 2018.\n\nNotably, the Trump tax cuts also doubled the child tax credit, reducing the tax burden on working families so that they have more resources to devote to their children...

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota ‚Äî another member of The Squad ‚Äî was recognized by 53% of the voters; 9% (not a typo) had a favorable view.\nSocialism was viewed favorably by 18% of the voters and unfavorably by 69%. Capitalism was 56% favorable; 32% unfavorable.\n‚ÄúSocialism is toxic to these voters,‚Äù said the top Democrat.‚Äù\nThe poll was reportedly conducted before the ongoing fight between Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and the ‚ÄúSquad,‚Äù a left-wing group centered around Ocasio-Cortez, who defines herself as a ‚Äúdemocratic socialist.‚Äù Last week, Pelosi and ‚ÄúAOC‚Äù sparred in the media, with the first-term congresswoman suggesting that Pelosi was racist for ‚Äúsingling out ‚Ä¶ women of color.‚Äù On Sunday, after a back-and-forth last week with Ocasio-Cortez ally Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who is a Somali refugee and has been harshly critical of the United States, Trump tweeted that the group should ‚Äúgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.‚Äù Ocasio-Cortez noted in response that she was from the U.S. Speaker Pelosi, setting differences aside, tweeted Sunday that the president‚Äôs comments affirmed her controversial claim that he wants to ‚Äúmake America white again.‚Äù She made the claim last year, then again earlier this month.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c4d49cdee6d9dfbacc7947dfcfae9d31/5E62A73C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/66421603_663161647495219_7819201620679465955_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz5-5LDnzbq/", "caption": "***OPEN DISCUSSION THREAD***", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/14e4048694215f04c3a413ea68d5e40c/5E57B657/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/65564855_714399208998768_8560574492125254758_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz542Nonfy5/", "caption": "‚¨õÔ∏èDEMOCRAT DEFIANCE‚¨õÔ∏è Baltimore‚Äôs mayor announced Friday that his city would not be the one to cooperate in a series of targeted immigration enforcement raids taking place on Sunday. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to cooperate,‚Äù said Democrat Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, who spoke Friday at a protest rally outside City Hall, according to a report from WJZ.\n\nYoung‚Äôs city is one of ten cities in the U.S. that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targeted for deportation raids that would expel anyone in the U.S. not in the country legally. ‚ÄúI said that we were not going to engage with ICE in the deportation or apprehension of any immigrants in the City of Baltimore.‚Äù Mayor Young added.\nPresident Donald Trump confirmed Friday that the raids would take place Sunday, and would mostly be focused on criminals with ‚Äúfinal deportation orders.‚Äù The raids are expected to last several days in ten different cities‚Äî including Atlanta, Denver, Baltimore, Chicago, New York, Houston, Miami, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.\n\nOther Democrat mayors, including Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have also vowed not to cooperate with federal immigration officers conducting the raids.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8671c0523022d109b89f3bb497555996/5E3E174B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.83.1391.1391a/s640x640/65471822_138030680732845_5350143512980123741_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz5xmElnMYG/", "caption": "üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b921c2f5ba0b49bc1dd263e34577f8e4/5E595249/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66122258_620464528440653_4292761469855182749_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz5NedyH6oX/", "caption": "üòÇüòÇJust when you thought the 2020 Democrat Clown Car couldn‚Äôt get anymore nutty.üòÇüòÇ 2020 presidential candidate Gov.

The latest analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies Director of Research Steven Camarotta compared and contrasted the cost to American taxpayers of millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S. over a lifetime and the cost of deportation.\n\nBased on research from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the cost of illegal aliens to American taxpayers over a lifetime is about $746.3 billion. Compare this to the cost of a single deportation, which is about $10,854 per illegal alien based on Fiscal Year 2016 totals.\n\nOverall, deporting every illegal alien in the country would amount to a cost savings of about $622 billion over the course of a lifetime. This indicates that deporting illegal aliens is six times less costly than what it costs American taxpayers to currently subsidize the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a high cost of cheap labor,‚Äù Camarotta told Breitbart News.\n\nLast year, President Trump‚Äôs administration deported more than 256,000 illegal aliens from the U.S. Assuming that the cost of deportations has been largely unchanged since the Obama administration, this would mean that last year‚Äôs deportations, alone, cost about $2.8 billion.

That number was revised even lower on Friday, to just 72,000. April‚Äôs number was revised down to 216,000 from 224,000. Economists surveyed by Econoday had been looking for a gain of 165,000 for June and for unemployment to remain steady at 3.6 percent. The June number will also be looked to as a barometer for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy. Last month, the Fed signaled that it was ready to cut rates if the economy continued to show signs of slowing and inflation remained low. The stronger than expected number may create some hesitancy to cut rates. While the economy has continued to grow in the second quarter, it has shown signs of slowing from the rapid 3.1 percent rate of growth in the first three months of the year. Manufacturing has been a weak spot while consumer spending and the labor market have been strong. Economic weakness around the globe may also be weighing on the U.S. economy by reducing demand for U.S. exports. And uncertainty around trade may also be making businesses hesitant to invest and hire.\n\nWith unemployment near 50-year lows, job growth has slowed. Employment growth has averaged 172,000 per month thus far this year, compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018. But wage gains have gone the opposite direction. In June, average hourly wages were 3.1 percent above the year-prior level.\n\nManufacturing jobs showed renewed strength, adding 17,000 jobs after four months of coming in flat.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Center for Immigration Studies Director of Research Steven Camarotta told Breitbart News that only rough estimates are available for what health care for illegal aliens will cost American taxpayers, and though a comprehensive study has yet to be conducted on this specific issue, taxpayers can expect to pay a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù amount. ‚ÄúIf we offered Medicaid for illegal immigrants, it is possible the costs could be over tens of billions of dollars,‚Äù Camarotta said. ‚ÄúHowever, it would depend on eligibility criteria as well as how many illegal immigrants actually sign up for program once it was offered. So while the actual costs are uncertain, the size would be significant for taxpayers.‚Äù A reasonable estimate of health care for each illegal alien, Camarotta said, is about $3,000 ‚Äî about half the average $6,600 that it currently costs annually for each Medicaid recipient. This assumes that a number of illegal aliens already have health insurance through employers and are afforded free health care today when they arrive to emergency rooms.

Among swing voters, about 6-in-10, or 60 percent, said they opposed providing taxpayer-funded health care to illegal aliens, and middle class Americans are the most likely to say they oppose offering free health care benefits to illegal aliens.\n\nIn total, about 56 percent of likely voters earning between $30,000 to $50,000 say they oppose taxpayer-funded health care for illegal aliens. Likewise, 62 percent of likely voters earning $50,000 to $100,000 say they oppose taxpayer-funded health care for illegal aliens.\n\nThe poll shows the gap between the country‚Äôs electorate and 2020 Democrat presidential primary candidates, the majority of whom have vowed to offer free health care to illegal aliens that is paid for by American taxpayers.\n\nAs Breitbart News has estimated, providing free health care to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens could cost American taxpayers up to $660 billion every ten years.

In the latest edition of The Drill Down With Peter Schweizer @drilldowntv , published at RealClearInvestigations on Wednesday, Schweizer highlights the following figures:\n\n430 former politicians ‚Äî both congressmen and senators ‚Äî are now being paid to help shape government policies as lobbyists, consultants, and in other capacities.\n60 percent ‚Äî nearly two-thirds ‚Äî of the 44 members who took new jobs after leaving Congress in 2019 now work in lobbying, consulting, or otherwise influencing government activities.\n‚ÄúWho says bipartisanship is dead in Washington?‚Äù jokingly asked Schweizer while highlighting former politicians of both parties who now ‚Äúwork to help special interests navigate the corridors of power in Washington.‚Äù Featured examples of the ‚Äúrevolving door‚Äù phenomenon used by Schweizer to illustrate his thesis include former Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) and Reps.

Of the ten presidential candidates who appeared Wednesday, only one, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), has any real chance (at this point) of winning the nomination. The rest of the lineup included that fake Hispanic Beto O‚ÄôRourke, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), America‚Äôs worst mayor Bill de Blasio, and a bunch of other people no one is going to vote for.\n\nThe second part of this debate arrives Thursday night with a little more wattage: front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, along with media faves Mean Little Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris.

Prior to joining Congress, he was governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1963, an office he originally sought on the basis of his opposition to the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which struck down segregation in public schools. Hollings kept that stance for the early portion of his term, but eventually changed course and supported integration. It has been noted, though, that full desegregation of South Carolina‚Äôs public schools did not occur until after he left the governorship.\n\nIn the Senate, Hollings cut a moderate to liberal profile by championing a national hunger policy and working to reign in the deficit. During his tenure, Hollings‚Äô views on race appeared to grow and develop ,as exhibited by his endorsement of Jesse Jackson in the 1988 presidential race. The issue, however, was still complicated at the time. In 1993, Hollings stirred controversy by saying African diplomats only attended international conferences to ‚Äúget a good square meal‚Äù rather than ‚Äúeating each other.‚Äù When eulogizing Hollings in April, Biden noted his life and views were heavily influenced by the times.\n\nThe fish fry was Biden‚Äôs first major public appearance since invoking the late-Sens.

Under prior presidents, including Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, migrants in the United States have been allowed to freely apply for green cards via the ‚ÄúAdjustment of Status‚Äù process. This ‚ÄúAoS‚Äù process is a continuous, unrecognized amnesty because it gives green cards to roughly 550,000 people each year, including many illegals and people who overstay their legal visas. Illegals also use the AoS process to get temporary work permits. In 2018, for example, 257,376 work permits were handed out to a variety of people who applied for AoS.\n\nOne of the few curbs on the AoS amnesty is a requirement that applicants find a sponsor who will repay the taxpayers for any aid and welfare consumed by the AoS applicant. This curb, however, is unused because officials rarely require the sponsors to repay taxpayers when the would-be immigrants do not earn enough wages to stay off welfare. The policy may deter immigrants and citizens from sponsoring unskilled migrants, thus reducing the scale and cost of low-skilled immigration that is imposed on Americans, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. ‚ÄúA normal person will think twice and say ‚ÄòWhoa, I don‚Äôt think I want to take on that [financial sponsorship] responsibility,'‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis is a really good change. ‚Ä¶ It is about making people qualify [for green cards] based on their likelihood of being self-supporting, and [about] not approving people who will go to the nearest welfare office,‚Äù she told Breitbart New Tonight on June 14.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1c5c01b4e60fecea8b790f953c86cc3c/5E3E5249/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.35.1308.1308a/s640x640/64994703_1024824627726960_2509764132140604806_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/By0CPfpHxTC/", "caption": "During an appearance on ‚ÄúSunday Morning Futures‚Äù @mariabartiromo on Fox News Channel, senior White House trade adviser Peter Navarro praised the tariffs used by President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to Navarro, the tariffs achieved more in two days on immigration than Congress was able to accomplish in 20 years. ‚ÄúPolls show that about 80 percent of Americans believe there‚Äôs a crisis at the border. If you ask Americans in a poll, what do you think about 100,000 illegal aliens moving every day on a conveyor belt from Guatemala up to San Diego and El Paso, I‚Äôd say about 90% of them would object to that.

Mnuchin indicated that the redesigned bill would make an emergence in 2028 with designs coming out two years prior. However, the New York Times spoke to an anonymous employee of the bureau, who supposedly viewed a digital image of the redesigned bill.\nThat source fueled speculation from the New York Times, which pondered if Mnuchin ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù the release in order to avoid conflict from Trump, who is a fan of the Andrew Jackson $20 bill.\n‚ÄúBut the Treasury Department, which oversees the engraving bureau, decided that a new $20 bill would not be made public next year.

Caucasian voters are equally split among the two, but with Trump leading with 47 percent to Biden‚Äôs 46 percent.\nWhen it comes to African-American and Hispanic voters, however, the poll shows Trump making a marked improvement over his 2016 numbers.

Trump‚Äôs share of the African-American vote in that race surprised many because it was larger than the six percent Mitt Romney received in 2012.

Such a rate of illegal immigration would also take the U.S. back to levels not seen since Fiscal Year 2006, when President Bush oversaw massive totals of border crossings.\n\nMeanwhile, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan has admitted that his agency is merely acting as a checkpoint for illegal aliens, with all adult border crossers arriving with children getting released into the interior of the U.S.mere months‚Äô time, these adult border crossers ‚Äî now living freely in the country ‚Äî are receiving work permits to take U.S. jobs.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a3d0381fafbbd2f08950493d275cfcf6/5E56E700/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.121.1440.1440a/s640x640/60771108_418237115397829_5781136540949664570_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByXk2nqn0o7/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/24013460256cfe396128f2c2d04b8c6a/5DC1A9BC/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/61080996_694619477625649_1073414290375452684_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByXkotknhdo/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a203529449bdc1a4d40b14b66e6ac47a/5DC10EA4/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/61467637_404897886775072_9010415717615700129_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWsbL2Hp6m/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e7ba7890aa8421eb2403c8a0105a633f/5E59499E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/60568620_130485014814896_7273717783634881246_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWEJvUnURS/", "caption": "üî¥Donald Trump Jr. DESTROYS Biden on feckless China posture!üî¥ Donald Trump Jr. @donaldjtrumpjr tweeted on Wednesday that former Vice President Joe Biden is ‚Äúincentivized‚Äù to dismiss the threat posed by China because of his son‚Äôs business dealings with the Chinese government.

For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior‚Äù (1 Timothy 2:2‚Äì3).\nOn June 2, we ask that pastors would lead their congregations in praying for the President, that Sunday schools and other groups would join together and pray, and that individuals and families across the country would have a special focus on praying for the President that day.\nWould you let me know in the comments below if you commit to pray with us? And will you share this on your social media platforms so that we can have as many people as possible praying?\n‚ÄòFor we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places‚Äô (Ephesians 6:12).‚Äù", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/015cef22cb852de015bc561495796131/5E60FBD6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.33.1305.1305a/s640x640/60988055_144224053302980_3116353461343183740_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx7exqlnV1k/", "caption": "üá∫üá∏ #memorialdayweekend üá∫üá∏ ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY ‚Äî Most have deployed in the double-digit figures ‚Äî all over the world, and to Iraq and Afghanistan multiple times.\n\nBut one thing remains the same ‚Äî their yearly trek to Arlington National Cemetery to pay respects to their fallen Green Beret brothers.\n\nThe Special Forces Brotherhood Motorcycle Club and its various chapters from all over the country gather every year at the Arlington National Cemetery to honor and remember friends who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nüì∑Kristina Wong, Breitbart News", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/555c7b698404e6c99694af75a6c7cabb/5E5CB8F6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/60706319_340202643334642_6409888497905317512_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx7Thrcnnbk/", "caption": "President Donald Trump ripped television actor Jussie Smollett on Saturday, after the actor‚Äôs embarrassing hoax accusing Trump supporters of attacking him. ‚ÄúIn addition to great incompetence and corruption, The Smollett case in Chicago is also about a Hate Crime,‚Äù Trump wrote on Twitter.

The order ensures that federal agencies will enforce the existing 1996 laws which seek to save American taxpayers by having their public welfare funding benefits reimbursed when they are used by a legal immigrant.\n\nThe first function of the order mandates that a family member or business sponsor of a legal immigrant looking to permanently resettle in the U.S. is responsible for paying back the welfare costs previously used by that immigrant. For example, if a visa holder has used $10,000 in food stamp benefits while living in the U.S., when a family member sponsors them for a green card, that family member will be notified of the legal immigrant‚Äôs welfare costs to taxpayers and obligated to pay back the amount.\n\nIf the sponsor of a legal immigrant does not pay the welfare cost, the Treasury Offset Program will take the money out of the sponsor‚Äôs taxes for that year. Federal officials said implementation of this order would begin in September.\n\nA senior administration official told Breitbart News that the order to enforce Clinton‚Äôs 1996 law will drive down welfare-dependent legal immigration to the U.S. which has cost American taxpayers billions over the years. ‚ÄúThis is a historic, transformative action to restore the foundational principle of U.S. immigration law: that those seeking to join our society must support themselves financially,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúThis executive action will dramatically curb ‚Äòwelfare tourism‚Äô and protect U.S. benefits for U.S. families,‚Äù the official continued.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bddb8a745a5f7de41a90bfd96e6cb4d1/5E50A5A2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.98.1414.1414a/s640x640/60418739_528846310977712_2556623268284616303_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx0KqVMnRu4/", "caption": "üî∂BOMBSHELLüî∂ In the inaugural episode of @drilldowntv , investigator and bestselling author Peter Schweizer revealed the foreign influence peddling scandal engulfing Joe Biden‚Äôs 2020 presidential campaign in a new video series produced by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Institute (GAI).

The salary and wage component rose even more‚Äìby a full percentage point. The last time manufacturing saw quarterly wage gains that high was in 2008, when wages also rose 1.0 percent in the January through March period. Compared with a year ago, manufacturing wages were up 2.9 percent in March. That‚Äôs the biggest 12-month gain since March of 2003, when wages rose 3.2 percent.\n\nBy Barack Obama‚Äôs final year in office, manufacturing wages were rising an average of just 0.625 a quarter.\n\nVery low inflation means that unlike past gains in worker pay, these have not been eaten away by higher prices. Prices in March were up just 1.5 percent compared with year-earlier levels, which makes the real wage gain 1.4 percent. Back in March 2003, prices were up 2.5 percent. So most of the paycheck growth went to higher prices. In March of 2008, the situation was even worse: 3.1 percent inflation meant workers were actually losing ground despite growing paychecks. There‚Äôs another reason to think that the first quarter of 2019 may have been better than either 2003 or 2008.

Instead, China has used its membership in the World Trade Organization as an instrument for its economic advancement aimed directly at the expense of other more developed member states. Moreover, it has tightened its one-party authoritarian rule, increased repression of domestic dissent, and escalated human rights abuses within its borders. And it is building up its military‚Äôs might‚Äîincluding new capabilities to menace Taiwan, Japan, and other neighbors to threaten U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific region, and to project power globally. China now is trying to fool the world again by luring foreign governments to join its Belt and Road Initiative with extravagant promises of Chinese investment for their infrastructure projects.\n\nSome countries have already learned hard lessons from Beijing‚Äôs debt-trap diplomacy. For example, Sri Lanka was forced to give a Chinese state-owned company majority control of its $1.3 billion Hambantota port for 99 years after it defaulted on a Chinese loan, and Pakistan is now seeking to drastically curb borrowing from China as it faces a mounting debt crisis.\n\nYet these and other cautionary tales aren‚Äôt deterring everyone.

Florida‚Äôs Amendment Four was approved by voters during last year‚Äôs Midterm election.\nThe heavily Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union and Brennan Center for Justice based in New York both served as consultants in drafting Amendment Four.\n\nSoros‚Äôs Open Society Foundations donated $50 million to the ACLU.

That‚Äôs what led to this was resentment and aggression that I grew up with towards my real dad. And as I got older I realized my dad never had his dad in his life.

It is unlikely, for example, that the unemployment rate will rise above last month‚Äôs 3.8 percent.\n\nJobless claims can be volatile on a week to week basis.

Likewise, every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of low-skilled U.S. occupations reduces wages by about 0.8 percent.

Additionally, Princeton Policy Advisors researcher Steven Kopits projects that in 2019, there will be up to 500,000 illegal aliens at the southern border who successfully cross into the U.S. undetected by Border Patrol agents. These are foreign nationals whom federal immigration officials are unaware of and are usually only deported after they commit a crime in the U.S. Also, should visa overstay levels continue at the same pace as in Fiscal Year 2017, there could potentially be about 630,000 illegal aliens added to the U.S. population after overstaying their visas.\n\nCenter for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Jessica Vaughan told Breitbart News that experts predict there to be anywhere between 300,000 to 400,000 visa overstays this year.\n\nThese projections put the number of illegal aliens added to the U.S. population at around one to 1.5 million, on top of the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens who are already living across the country.

This is an important day for me, personally as this has been the primary mission of Turning Point USA @turningpointusa .\nNot too many opinion people are weighing in on this yet. It is kind of a difficult topic for them. Those in the mainstream media, an ideologically homogeneous group, need to thread the needle of wanting to appear to be in favor of free speech while arguing that the president requiring free speech is somehow dangerous. That isn‚Äôt easy and that is why they have been mostly silent.\nDon‚Äôt worry. They will figure it out soon and they will find a way to come after the president.\nAn exception to the silence of analysts is an opinion piece published by CNN on March 18. In it, Suzanne Nossel and Jonathan Friedman of PEN America share their concerns about the upcoming order. The piece is not unreasonable in its tone, and it does fairly point out examples of how team left university officials and students are stifling free speech on campus.\nBut the writers do make one critical mistake, and it is the same one that is used dismissively by everyone from politicians, to university administrators, to media commentators... The shutting down of free speech on campus is a systemic and institutionalized process that is controlled and managed by what we ironically label as ‚Äúliberals.‚Äù Burn an American flag on campus or stand on a bench and decry the Constitution as racist and you will be allowed to speak.

In the end, they all forsook him and fled.\n\nIt is very important to remember that all of this has come to a head over the past five months because the President did not place his own Party in the position of having to shut the government down while they controlled both Houses of Congress.  For two years the President had a majority in the House and in the Senate and tried to rely on them to cooperate in getting our border secured.\n\nThey did what is in their nature to do.

This is called a filibuster, when senators are deliberately continuing debate for the purpose of preventing a vote ‚Äì unless three-fifths of senators (60) vote to break the filibuster by invoking cloture.

Historically it has generally not been used on presidential nominations. You can amend legislation, but a nomination is a simple yes-or-no proposition. Article II of the Constitution specifies that all federal judges require Senate confirmation, as do senior positions in the administration. Currently, 1,200 positions out of 4,100 political appointments in a presidential administration are ‚Äúprincipal officers‚Äù that are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nTheoretically, the Senate could use its confirmation power to keep seats on the federal judiciary ‚Äì including even the Supreme Court ‚Äì open indefinitely.

The cross has been owned and maintained by a state park‚Äôs commission since 1961. Atheists claimed in a lawsuit that the monument, known as the Peace Cross, violated the constitution‚Äôs ban on the establishment of religion. Last year, a federal appeals court held that the cross must be removed or modified to erase any appearance of an endorsement of religion. Perhaps the biggest surprise of the hearing was that some of the court‚Äôs liberal justices appeared sympathetic to the defenders of the cross. Justice Elena Kagan noted that the cross became a particular symbol associated with those killed in World War I. Justice Stephen Breyer asked about the importance of historical context to this case, indicating that older crosses could be permissible but erecting new religious symbols would not. ‚ÄúHistory matters,‚Äù Breyer said. ‚ÄúSo what about saying past is past, if you go back 93 years, but no more.‚Äù Conservatives argued that the court should rethink its approach to religious symbols on public property, arguing that earlier decisions had created a confusing mess of precedent that invited endless litigation and was not well-grounded in the constitution.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ef5db6121b5bb2f5f538092522495aaf/5E58893D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.23.1080.1080a/s640x640/51973338_348369002555053_1496596953103053117_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuZJPdhH4ha/", "caption": "üîµDemocrat Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris: We Need Slave Reparations to ‚ÄòHeal‚Äô African-American ‚ÄòTrauma‚Äôüîµ Sen.
