Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) argued hurricanes, superstorms, and tornadoes were on the rise because of anthropogenic climate change.\n\nWhile discussing the flooding in New York State, Cuomo said, “Anyone who questions extreme weather and climate change is just delusional at this point. We have seen in the state of New York what every one has seen. We see these weather patterns that we never had before. We didn’t have hurricanes. We didn’t have superstorms. We didn’t have tornadoes. This is a storm that came up just overnight, dropped about five inches of rain, and it was literally a matter of life or death for people.” He added, “I was at one of the sites this morning, a river overcame its banks with five inches of water, ran through a residential neighborhood. The streets looked like rivers themselves. People were trapped in their homes. The one home you’re mentioning was people were afraid the house itself was going to be swept away. Luckily we train with the swift water rescue teams, and they literally took five people out of the home, including an infant, but it was a very dangerous and very precarious situation. Thank God we have the best first responders, I believe, in the United States, and everyone got off safely. But this is a recurring pattern, and anyone who is still in denial is making a very serious mistake.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5c90fc56d488dfc2a2d90e4d0917728b/5E55F771/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.69.1346.1346a/s640x640/71921311_560949411326627_7774387451099490908_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4WAyiHnv-3/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f9e56cad0f4c5b0489aa7def0ab7d53c/5DC11A50/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/72711076_2441935729392427_6546344571281236763_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4V5Go8nMOd/", "caption": "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c59920cf13e0c109726c88d36e43ba13/5E532237/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.4.1177.1177a/s640x640/74603493_183980512739453_2277938237753600188_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Vm3EsHRaU/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/362a394ead39717e826c0d2c1cc8def6/5DC1DE9D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/71703503_144528896891791_5334178964152806918_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4VKG8xnUdS/", "caption": "Nearly a majority of American registered voters disapprove of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s job performance as she moves toward impeaching President Donald Trump, according to a poll released Friday.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC News poll released Friday found that 48 percent of American adults disapprove of the way Pelosi is handling her job as Speaker, while 38 percent disapprove of the House leader.

Clearly, there are people that we serve with that don’t like the results of the 2016 election — that’s their prerogative — but the country next year will be deciding who our president is going to be. It should not be Nancy Pelosi and a small group of people that she selects that get to determine who’s going to be our president.” He went on to say that Democrats are not interested in getting to the bottom of the allegations that triggered the impeachment effort. Instead, their focus is solely on removing President Donald Trump from office and overturning the results of the 2016 elections, Scalise indicated. “They don’t really want to get to the truth. They want to remove a sitting president. In fact, the author of the articles of impeachment [Democrat Rep. Al Green from Texas] said, ‘if they don’t impeach the president, he will get re-elected.’ Now that’s not why we have impeachment.” “It’s a tainted process,” he added, referring to the impeachment probe.\n\nHouse Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry are supposed to be trying to determine if Trump abused his power by pushing Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in exchange for aid.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c461273d65f3d408563660c7f06185bc/5E60C289/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.180.1440.1440a/s640x640/73423630_184841525890524_1606098910563619550_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4TRl4zHtTC/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/72507820f57ff3e461f7e49bf549beec/5DC10B21/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/73446488_502229100633036_5135152984623271594_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4TDCNeH2e4/", "caption": "🤣🤣RUN HILLARY RUN!!!🤣🤣", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/68aa6c9db81b8101cd7be070bf330d68/5E641E37/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c125.0.991.991a/s640x640/74947260_721755468324768_707254200727064158_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4TCy6LHARp/", "caption": "◾️◾️RIGGED◾️◾️ The impeachment inquiry resolution put forth by House Democrats includes a “loophole” that would give the majority party, or Democrats, on the Judiciary Committee the power to reject witnesses requested by the White House, Roll Call reports.\n\nDemocrats released the text of the inquiry resolution on Tuesday, which Republicans say does little to nothing to address their concerns moving forward.

In other words, the provision gives Nadler and fellow Democrats on the committee power to reject White House witnesses as a form of retribution. “While those due process rights generally align with ones afforded in the previous two presidential impeachments, they provide a big caveat that allows Democrats to strip Trump’s rights away as easily as they gave them to him,” Roll Call explains, adding that the provision applies “to Trump’s stonewalling of any ongoing probes in the Intelligence, Oversight, Foreign Affairs, Judiciary, Financial Services and Ways and Means committees.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/73c29c8b03a105cea411d89a9eb2cb98/5E4BCEA6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.119.1440.1440a/s640x640/71180302_431195174247486_5824326632996334859_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4S-DC_HiHu/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/882912e39532cd7842ac636896f2b137/5DC186B7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/74656387_3091653700908931_6006201307676346746_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4S5wKuHUVx/", "caption": "Rep.

Justin Amash (I-MI) voted with Democrats.\n\nVan Drew cited his constituents in making his decision as well as “serious concerns” with how the impeachment process has been run so far by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA).", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/97f02d3df14b01a99a5fd5565baa862b/5E49ACD8/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.125.1440.1440a/s640x640/73214673_453586198606726_7834618830866682665_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4SpozZHGTP/", "caption": "Turning Point USA @turningpointusa contributor Alex Clark @realalexclark told Breitbart News about her new original show, POPlitics @poplitics , which will cover “all things pop culture and lifestyle from a uniquely conservative perspective.” Clark spoke to SiriusXM’s @siriusxm Breitbart News Daily host Alex Marlow @marlownews in a Wednesday interview for the show’s weekly TPUSA campus report. “You just get the daily dose of the top three or four, maybe five things that people are talking about on any given day,” explained Clark on Wednesday. “I know this morning — we’re going to be talking about how Sean Spicer is just shaking things up in the reality TV world.” “I mean, people are so ticked off that he still on Dancing With The Stars,” continued Clark, “and it’s because conservatives, they keep voting for him, and it’s funny, because before, these same people that are now complaining that Sean Spicer is getting the popular vote on Dancing With The Stars, they were all for the popular vote in 2016, right?” Clark explained that while her show will have a conservative perspective, the show will be mainly focused on what’s trending in pop culture. Thus, effectively “casting a really wide net out there to catch people that may not even be conservative.” “Maybe they’re a-political, maybe they’re leftists, but everyone, no matter what side of aisle you’re on, you’re consuming pop culture,” said Clark, adding that her added perspective may inspire non-political people to think differently. “Conservatives are finally demanding that we get a seat at the table when it comes to culture — because we’re seeing a complete shift right now in pop culture,” added the TPUSA contributor.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b0bafdac90ddfb176d5ddda6ed0107db/5E447A5A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.49.1334.1334a/s640x640/72482622_147986453267018_5224976417848435226_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4SkU0BnF6d/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/05e84691c38b2a427b535d35b0e7a46f/5DC20705/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/75640837_508469676667067_6617035422042090550_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4SOAl1nz8N/", "caption": "🇺🇸❤️🐶 President Donald Trump said he would welcome the hero dog “Conan” to the White House after the K-9 was wounded during the successful American raid against ISIS founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nTrump revealed on Twitter the dog would come to the White House for a visit next week.\n\nThe establishment media predictably freaked after the president shared an obviously photoshopped image of him awarding the dog a Medal of Honor. “The ‘live’ version of Conan will be leaving the Middle East for the White House sometime next week!” Trump wrote on Twitter.

The bill, known as the Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government (SWAG) Act, prohibits the federal government from spending money to create a “mascot” to promote an agency, as well as producing swag such as fidget spinners, koozies, and mascots. “I am rolling out a new bill in my efforts to hold the federal government more accountable and watch our spending,” Ernst said. “It is called the SWAG Act. It is the Stop Wasteful Advertising by the Government Act, and what a lot of folks don’t realize is that the federal government spends over $1.4 billion on public relations and advertising campaigns. That is twice the amount that is dedicated to breast cancer research, and while I’m all about the mascots and things like that of course as an Iowa State Cyclone fan and you know what? For the federal government, there’s really no justifications spending a quarter of a million dollars in taxpayer money on mascots and millions more on swag.” “So what the bill will do is that it will prohibit agencies from purchasing and distributing swag, like coloring books, koozies, fidget spinners, and of course, creating their own mascots,” the Iowa senator added.\n\nThe SWAG Act will also require agencies to disclose spending on public relations and advertising spending.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/eb01f9a5dcd2efcbe2085e4e2fd519fa/5E4FB0C9/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.180.1440.1440a/s640x640/70997232_1753051308160679_3461151916089383623_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4NjLFYngWU/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3ab7cd362a67ab6f015cace82e8fa67b/5E40CFCB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/72359783_1389748371193066_7412736577965068317_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4NiT0xntfq/", "caption": "🕺💃 Spicy Wins AGAIN as Breitbart Nation Delivers Big Votes on “Dancing with the Stars!”🕺💃 Viewers were left in disbelief after former White House press secretary Sean Spicer @seanmspicer advanced to yet another round of Dancing with the Stars Monday night, with some calling it “bullshit” and others lamenting “the scariest thing about #DWTS is that Sean Spicer is still dancing.” Spicer and dancing partner Lindsay Arnold danced the Jive to “Monster Mash” for DWTS’ Halloween-themed night. Despite receiving what ET described as “by far, the lowest scores of the night” — 18/30 — the dancing duo did not find themselves in the bottom two, thanks to the weight of fan votes. It means that conservatives, as Spicer has mentioned on Breitbart News Sunday, are showing up and sending a message to Hollywood.\n\nViewers, particularly those on the left, were in disbelief. “The scariest thing about #DWTS is that Sean Spicer is still dancing,” one user wrote. “What is happening on dancing with the Stars???

We have lost two great ones because people vote for this mediocre dancer.

His wife, Annette, was by his side through the entire process,” the foundation’s website stated.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/192e43736cfb075528f42896801174ad/5E487CB3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.37.1312.1312a/s640x640/71527451_407893536570705_3132601633732264915_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4DR-ornXWF/", "caption": "🔴Yes, Charles, how DARE the Vice President of the United States of America @vp stand up for America and against Communism?!🔴", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6fa64416d456f4a80256569583af1265/5E4F12AF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c83.0.1075.1075a/s640x640/75545955_517063199136699_7713395407241924937_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B4DKTshn6CS/", "caption": "◾️◾️Just when you thought Hillary Clinton couldn’t sink any lower or be more a grey and bitter...◾️◾️ On Friday during Rep.

Think again.🔶 Motorists in Venezuela have started paying for gasoline with items such as cigarettes and candy bars due to the worthlessness of the country’s bolivar currency, a report revealed Tuesday.\n\nA report from the Associated Press revealed that, with the government effectively giving out free gasoline, many gas station employees are instead asking for simple bribes such as cigarettes, candy bars, a bag of rice, or cooking oil. Most attendants do not know the price, and those who are empty-handed just get waved through having paid nothing at all. “You can pay with a cigarette,” Orlando Molina, told the agency while filling up his subcompact Ford Ka in Caracas. “Heck, it’s no secret to anyone that it goes for nothing.” The government has long subsidized gasoline since Hugo Chávez came to power in 1998 as an integral part of his socialist revolution. Yet despite the stratospheric levels of hyperinflation, the Maduro regime has refused to raise prices, meaning that the cost of filling up a tank is equivalent to just a fraction of a cent. One Caracas resident, identified as María Pérez, told the agency that many customers would happily pay more for gas if the government would use the proceeds to invest in improving road safety. “Our roads are unbearable,” she explained. “There are huge holes — craters — that not only damage our cars but also put our own lives at risk.” Maduro has acknowledged that the state-run oil company Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA) runs a deficit of billion dollars a year because of the enormous discrepancy between the cost of gasoline and the costs of production.\n\nThe low cost of fuel is helped by the fact that Venezuela sits upon the world’s largest oil reserves, although that has not prevented widespread shortages of gasoline, with oil production last year falling to under one million barrels a day, a thirty-year low.

None of our students were involved in any of those things.” One reason for the wrongful conflation was likely due to the university’s president, Joyce McConnell, who bizarrely sent an email to the entire CSU student body in which she compared Kirk and his organization to “blackface” and a swastika.\n\nSubsequently, students had become outraged Brown’s event featuring Kirk, @donaldjtrumpjr Trump Jr., and Guilfoyle as speakers on Tuesday. “We came out and said that those things were horrible, and we have nothing to do with that,” said Brown, “but because we’re a conservative organization on campus, a lot of people are just willing to loop us in with any of the horrible things that happen on campus, because they want to silence us.” “When Charlie Kirk got on stage last night, he made it clear that Turning Point USA is not involved in those things, and we do not stand for racism,” continued Brown, adding that students had nonetheless arrived before the event to protest.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b21fed89f4cfd3fcdfb4895573fd7e24/5E4B4E5F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/73387398_142658637050781_4331704537002890317_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3-WsdZF8kq/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9c226fc7d184b7d60c9e66c0cf490881/5DC16908/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/71716389_966671633685228_1632572914963356704_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3-Oy3CntfK/", "caption": "A memo by the Republican National Committee (RNC) that contains internal GOP polling data shows the American public, even Democrat voters, are turning against the Democrat Party’s “impeachment inquiry” into President Donald Trump.\n\nThe memo, obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, shows independent voters nationwide en masse oppose impeachment—with 54 percent opposed and only 34 percent in favor. “We have seen public polling drastically under sample Independent voters, which is one of the many reasons for so much incorrect public data over the past month,” the memo explains regarding the disparity between internal GOP numbers and public polling from news organizations and polling institutions.

That is when something rose up inside of me – I wanted to keep my baby because I would not allow a stranger to tell me my child’s fate.”❤️ A mother with a rare form of breast cancer gave birth to her baby boy in July after she endured several rounds of chemotherapy.\n\nWhen 36-year-old Jade Devis of Loma Linda, California, was diagnosed with stage 2 triple-negative breast cancer during the first trimester of her pregnancy earlier this year, she was forced to make a decision about her unborn child’s future. “I did not know how I felt about the pregnancy until I was told I should not continue my pregnancy,” Devis said. “That is when something rose up inside of me – I wanted to keep my baby because I would not allow a stranger to tell me my child’s fate.” Although her cancer was considered more aggressive and had a less positive prognosis than other types, it did not stop Devis from moving forward with treatment and finding a specialist who could help her navigate cancer and pregnancy at the same time. “His heart was beating. I could feel him inside. He was fighting, so I had to fight, too,” she stated.\n\nThankfully, the young mother found Dr. Gayathri Nagaraj, a breast cancer specialist at Loma Linda University Cancer Center who took special care of Devis throughout her pregnancy and chemotherapy sessions until she was ready to give birth this summer. “Going through chemotherapy is tough for anyone, and we do our very best to support our patients in every way we can at Loma Linda University Cancer Center,” said Dr. Nagaraj. “In Jade’s situation we had to be doubly cautious and alert to ensure the safety of the patient and the baby. I am extremely glad to be working with an amazing team who all came together to make this possible.” The young mother said she feels completely happy now that she is able to hold her son, Bradley, in her arms. “It is surreal to remember that my pregnancy had an element of extraordinary fear. I am blessed when I look at my son, and I cannot ask for more than that. My baby boy is my miracle child,” she concluded.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c7516c846646f60fc466373d911c29dc/5E4CB350/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.112.1436.1436a/s640x640/73470549_418492035525200_4126029617784408148_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B36ohHsnhSE/", "caption": "🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Sunday decried income inequality and the “top one percent” just one day after endorsing a millionaire.\n\nOcasio-Cortez tweeted a Business Insider report, which found that an individual needs to make “at least $500,000 a year” in order to make the “top one percent” in the United States. “A lot of people think that folks like your typical lawyer or doctor are in ‘the 1%.’ That may be bc it’s hard to conceive how bad runaway inequality has gotten,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote. “Even this number – $500k – reflects top income, & even THAT doesn’t hold a candle to recognizing concentrated wealth,” she added. The socialist lawmaker’s public complaint regarding the reality of “income inequality” comes just one day after she endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) – a millionaire – for president. According to Forbes, Sanders has a $2.5 million fortune, which he acquired via “estate, investments, government pensions—and earnings from three books,” many of which lament the very system that made his wealth possible. While his senator’s salary is $174,000 per year, Forbes notes that the socialist lawmaker has made a “six-figure annual salary since he joined Congress in 1991.” “With 28 years in office and a current salary of $174,000, Sanders is entitled to around $73,000 a year from the federal government for the rest of his life. If he were to sell that guaranteed income stream for a lump-sum pile of cash, Forbes figures he could get around $650,000 for it.” In 2016, Sanders purchased a $575,000 lake house – dubbed a “summer home” – in the Champlain Islands, making the socialist the proud owner of not one, not two, but three homes.\n\nDespite Sanders’ commitment to make the wealthy pay their “fair share” and eradicate the existence of billionaires, Sanders has been defensive of his own wealth accumulation.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/64b060fda9d676d04667bb6daea37427/5E5E0566/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.44.1324.1324a/s640x640/74609529_146119013319581_3812802338273619042_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3556GFH_Xw/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/25e239296bee6b5d801a7afc49f1c8ac/5DC1EA3D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71187453_138004147536262_3704157537593823404_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B35mlQJHJ-5/", "caption": "🔴TONIGHT: Viewers can vote for Sean Spicer and his dancing partner, Lindsay Arnold, between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. EST by texting SEAN to 21523 up to ten times and voting on ABC.com up to ten times.🔴 Former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told Breitbart News Sunday that Monday’s Dancing with the Stars will be a “big test” for the magnitude of the conservative voice in the entertainment industry, adding that his stay on the show is not just about him.

Mendoza writes to O’Rourke: “My son’s killer had multiple criminal convictions during his 20 years living illegally in America. Employing the same open borders rationale as O’Rourke, judges, policymakers and activists ensured that he was never deported.\nBeto O’Rourke has made it clear he wants the opposite. He wants us to believe that enforcing immigration law is tantamount to killing kids. That’s a slap in the face not just to legal immigrants, but to everyone who has suffered from the sort of weak immigration enforcement that O’Rourke desires.” Every year, about 2,000 Americans are killed by illegal aliens according to an analysis by Rep.

The RNC, which had $59.2 million in cash on hand last month, has nearly tripled the DNC fundraising in the current cycle, the political committee said. “While Democrats focus on fighting President Trump, Republicans have prioritized voters and we have another record-breaking fundraising month—the highest ever off-cycle—to show for it,” RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to Fox News. “Voters are tired of Democrats’ petty politics and baseless witch hunts, and their shameful attacks have only energized our grassroots army and allowed us to lay the groundwork for Republicans to take back the House, expand our majority in the Senate and re-elect President Trump in 2020.” The report follows a joint announcement by President Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign and the RNC in which they said a whopping combined $125.7 million was raised in the third quarter of 2019. The RNC will use some of the money raised to fund “Stop the Madness,” an anti-impeachment ad campaign designed to target vulnerable House Democrats running in moderate districts where voters are lukewarm to the idea of ousting the president. “Our goal is to cause chaos,” Rick Gorka, an RNC spokesperson, told Fox News. “This is a poison pill. When you couple the impeachment process with the socialist policies being espoused by 2020 Democrats, it’s going to sink their chances at the ballot box, especially with those crucial swing voters and independents across the country.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/70d26ce22898b7b7414c9414fd3bded3/5E5FC585/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.63.1341.1341a/s640x640/70887454_2489695124647761_5034625043363595666_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3uHGEvnmQ4/", "caption": "🎉🎉 Ok all you America-loving, gun-toting, Patriots...NOW look what you’ve done!

Back in 2013-2014, the White House put Biden in charge of Ukraine and a number of specific issues regarding the Chinese government. Riding his father’s coattails, and without any experience with either Ukraine or in the energy sector, Hunter secured a seat on the board of Burisma, where he was paid an incredible $50,000 a month — a month! — to the eventual tune of, according to some reports, three million dollars. In China, Hunter literally hitched a ride on Air Force Two with his dad to Beijing and secured a $1.5 billion — with a “B” — deal that could, according to FactCheck.org, eventually earn him tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnd what has been the real-world result of what stinks like a couple of foreign bribes…? Well, we have Joe Biden on video bragging about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired, a prosecutor who, under penalty of perjury, says he was investigating Burisma. To get this prosecutor fired, Biden admits to muscling Ukraine’s government into a quid pro quo: no U.S. aid unless you fire the guy.\n\nUkraine fired the guy. And then there’s Joe Biden’s sucking up to the same Chinese government that — through the Bank of China — handed a company in which Hunter has a ten percent stake in a cool $1.5 billion.\n\nWhen confronted with these obvious and utterly shameless conflicts of interest, the media allow Biden to hide behind his outrage over his integrity being challenged coupled with his now-debunked lie about never having discussed these shady overseas business deals with Hunter.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b303678ffa9e20e0e0db5dd554a21caf/5E400CE6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.118.1440.1440a/s640x640/71243489_505145873671937_5948701418567405344_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3sE6yJHEXy/", "caption": "Expectations for real incomes among the American public hit the highest level that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has ever tracked in its monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations.\n\nThe central bank said that in September expectations for inflation one year ahead rose slightly to 2.48 percent from 2.41 percent a month earlier. At the same time, expectations for earnings jumped to 2.54 percent from 2.26 percent. As a result, inflation-adjusted earnings expectations turned positive, rising to 0.06 percent. That might not seem like a huge positive but it is a record high in a metric that rarely even registers a figure above zero. Typically, the public’s expectations for inflation have outpaced expectations for earnings gains, suggesting the public expects to lose ground after price increases. The only two positive, non-zero readings on this measure were June and July of 2018, when the survey showed 0.05 percent expected real gains. The NY Fed’s survey data goes back to 2013.\n\nThe survey is constructed by asking the public where they expect their earnings to go if they kept the same job over the next year.\n\nAnother measure on the Fed survey asks about household income rather than individual earnings. This measure also hit a record high in inflation-adjusted terms, rising to a 0.45 percent improvement. This could provide support for consumer spending, a crucial force driving economic growth. Consumer expectations about household earnings can drive large purchases such as homes, cars, and major appliances.\n\nMany economic models of voter behavior also suggest that expectations for improving income can give a boost to incumbent candidates, suggesting that President Donald Trump may have a good chance of being re-elected. An analysis released recently by Moody’s said that Trump could easily beat his Democrat rivals even if the economy substantially deteriorates over the next year. Indeed, Moody’s “pocketbook” model–its most economically based–predicted Trump would “steamroll” his opponents.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/face3487a297fee5c35e5b8c6282bde1/5E55C93E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.132.1440.1440a/s640x640/73512660_245052933125258_6907069855611794378_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3r-udSHL72/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e0752722933be6bc5f4711a0e2ecd511/5DC2019F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/71274113_532924077472560_8072942345950109302_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3r8LrRn_4B/", "caption": "During CNN’s coverage of Tuesday’s Democratic presidential debate, CNN host John King stated that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden “was almost an afterthought” during the debate.\n\nKing said, “Without a doubt, I agree that the other candidates on that stage clearly thought it was in their best interest to go after Elizabeth Warren. … The vice president was almost an afterthought, Joe Biden, in this debate.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/cb00ebe8f6f1776a09c0fd6ff5dddf23/5E5E4988/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c63.0.1115.1115a/s640x640/70947503_463124507880111_6256917233560788579_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3r77f3HL_g/", "caption": "Billionaire Michael Bloomberg has signaled he would consider jumping into the presidential race if Joe Biden (D) – who lost his status as the solid frontrunner in recent weeks – falters in the primary.\n\nHe cautioned ahead of Tuesday evening’s debate that Democrat candidates need to tell voters how they will practically implement their lofty policy proposals.

And it’s why I believe Bernie Sanders is the best candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020,” the progressive lawmaker concluded.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/630c721cf0e204583e1374d9e0e27f60/5E4857AE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.39.1301.1301a/s640x640/74535088_165429861313968_2953437265949391049_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qdnULn8ns/", "caption": "@betoorourke #demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ae85bf1351ab972d7125f880ffaa5225/5E4B0ECD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71220939_177756176716075_716805964673378669_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qbzVKntRi/", "caption": "🤣🔥🤣🔥🤣🔥 #demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/848d2b2142a73c222f6bebe74ab66363/5E4DF417/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/73033588_745685515844188_992281764000815976_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qZyUbnGd4/", "caption": "#demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/995013c2237485a8cf67b4b64887a6e2/5E6268DD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71170026_1222547187944444_4705636536341101761_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qWxFyHkSo/", "caption": "#demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4a713779ca54521809a860c6aa2f9dc9/5E59D7AE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/72471480_122168582174262_5382740337271010057_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qVj2KHBcL/", "caption": "#demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/26e9b7b6ed4cf3097a9a97c7e4df94f9/5E4287CC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70497720_802433433506049_3048531573551776628_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qSUJiHt7a/", "caption": "***BREAKING***", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/75282755b33cea5a8ffeb94f936829dd/5E599F2B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/72948001_2141537632806984_2437907187038014601_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qON67n08f/", "caption": "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 #demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fb5706a655b15c837304a3f72df5877f/5E5D0BC8/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/73352740_422630808452183_5332137369321950799_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qKfmdHjcP/", "caption": "#demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8192ca93c48ad5059139b86eb9ab9cca/5E4B5C60/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70763336_679563099197322_607827871114771293_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qIdAXngaQ/", "caption": "***OPEN DISCUSSION THREAD*** #demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6a5aaad654ef5d58f0da7230607a4edb/5E537938/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71092118_476048046455709_7708589346980468500_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3qCg5gn7kz/", "caption": "🇺🇸💥🇺🇸💥🇺🇸💥🇺🇸\nDonald Trump may be on the path to a landslide re-election win in 2020.\n\nEach of the three election models used by Moody’s Analytics to forecast the 2020 election indicates that Donald Trump will likely win the presidential contest. Under two of the models, Trump is forecast to win with more than the 304 electoral college votes he garnered in 2016. “Under the average of the three models, Trump would hold on to key industrial Midwest states and pick up New Hampshire, Virginia and Minnesota,” Moody’s said in a report detailing the results of its models.

However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is a swamp in—in—in many ways? Yeah.” “So I take full responsibility for that,” the younger Biden continued. “Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever. Did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.” Later in the interview, Biden conceded he would “probably not” have served as a board member of Ukrainian energy giant Burisma Holdings if he were not the son of a vice president. “I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father,” he said. “That’s where I made the mistake.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/92308efe5c02f5dd88a1f6106a07de3f/5E6385FC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.27.1294.1294a/s640x640/73407386_533879060762930_1993830530279475690_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3pRId6n0nX/", "caption": "***OPEN DISCUSSION THREAD***", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/191ad44e35990ae9bc309ffd79fdbac5/5E4C098C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70870661_106507580658986_7750044269517007884_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3pCTQUHQKy/", "caption": "⬛️⬛️STONEWALL⬛️⬛️ Is it time for the government to investigate Hunter and Joe Biden’s Ukraine and China dealings?", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8cd9269c6f273df0a9cb6e380fc93fe9/5E40694C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70794634_386691218906856_1330873809212708748_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3orLi3nT4O/", "caption": "🎯💥🎯💥Monday, during an appearance on Fox Business Network’s “Varney & Company,” network morning anchor Maria Bartiromo @mariabartiromo spoke in defense of Columbus Day.\n\nShe suggested detractors set aside another day for so-called Indigenous Peoples’ Day. “Look, I would say, you know, Columbus Day has been a holiday for a long time – 200 years,” Bartiromo said. “I think because it is a historic holiday, I would vote to leave it in place, but that doesn’t mean not to celebrate indigenous people.

In a so-called “whistleblower” complaint, the officer alleged the president pressured Zelensky to look into allegations of corruption against former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden — a charge both world leaders deny. In recent days, several reports have raised red flags regarding the officer’s credibility. According to the Washington Examiner, the officer is not only a registered Democrat but also previously worked with Biden in the White House during the Obama administration. Nonetheless, Wallace has claimed that the House Democrats’ impeachment probe is worth pursuing. “It may not bear fruit, but there is some meat on the bones here, both in terms of what the president said to the Ukrainian president and the actions that he had taken to stop aid before he made that call. So, there’s going to be something here for Congress to investigate, whether it ends up rising to the levels of articles of impeachment, we don’t know,” the anchor said during a recent broadcast.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ece9029264b848ffe8617f8ef650dded/5E467D0E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.114.1439.1439a/s640x640/72984913_2172197833089491_948017403480275541_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3lE9yWnXfO/", "caption": "🔶🔶MAGA NATION COMETH🔶🔶", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5ad38f756b1e404e30c37d1b72c67c69/5E63A268/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71969082_446990249500223_2707099373985766217_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3k-tBcnfMx/", "caption": "⬛️⬛️ REVEALED: FactCheck cited Univ of Chicago’s Steven Kaplan who estimates Hunter Biden’s share in the Chinese investment firm could be valued at around $20,000,000.00. ⬛️⬛️ Former Vice President Joe Biden’s @joebiden son Hunter Biden announced Sunday that he was stepping down from his board position at BHR Equity Investment Fund Management, but he likely still has millions of dollars of value in the company.\n\nHunter Biden has a 10 percent stake in BHR, which he acquired through a company he created named Skaneateles LLC in 2017. Although Hunter Biden’s lawyer has said that his client’s stake in the company is only valued at $420,000, a FactCheck.org analysis estimates it’s value to be millions. “It is difficult to imagine, if not incomprehensible, that a 10% stake in those economics is worth only $420K,” Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business told FactCheck.org. “The distinction they appear to be making is they capitalized the management company with $4.2 M even if the fund manages $2 B. The value of that management company is likely far in excess of $4.2 M if they are managing $2 B.” FactCheck.org cited Kaplan estimating that Hunter Biden’s share in the investment company could be valued at around $20 million and up to “hundreds of millions of dollars” over the investment lifetime.\n\nHunter Biden’s lawyer said that if Joe Biden won the race for president, he would agree “not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies,” but did not mention his current foreign investments in BHR.\n\nPresident Donald Trump continues to target Hunter Biden’s foreign investments as corrupt, questioning Vice President Joe Biden’s knowledge of his son capitalizing on his father’s specific diplomacy with China and Ukraine on behalf of former President Barack Obama’s administration.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/96d4991844b127f93b0b1052f476e64b/5E5CE577/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.111.1435.1435a/s640x640/72267152_509262449895912_2015037018278575938_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3kxSH9HRW5/", "caption": "@berniesanders", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2514bea3e16e82488f54587e995c912a/5E5AE69D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71898039_436116817029507_2223322612590486974_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3kj7aonlFV/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/84bff84bfa794bd9bedae21aac547b55/5E3E9F92/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71918322_436102430352702_6133055817901594010_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3kfVRhncxq/", "caption": "🔥🎯🔥🎯🔥🎯🔥🎯🔥🎯🔥🎯🔥", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b18c2389176bcc6e5d99f32a65be6cca/5E45B9F4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70916263_157593202002853_1697858249913834072_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3kClEJHwq-/", "caption": "🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 Hunter Biden is walking away from the board of a Chinese-backed private equity company as part of a public pledge to disavow all foreign work if his father, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, gains the presidency in 2020.\n\nJoe Biden’s second son made his move after a month of pushing by U.S. President Donald Trump who has publicly highlighted the perceived – and real – conflicts of interest represented by Biden’s work in Asia.

At Biden’s urging, the chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin was fired and the investigation was eventually closed. Biden, during an official work trip to China in late 2013, brought his son, who had business meetings during the trip. After the trip, a Chinese private equity fund his son was forming received a Chinese business license that brought the fund into existence. Paul told reporters Tuesday on a conference call, “I’m with most Americans that Hunter Biden making $50,000 a month doesn’t pass the smell test. It sounds really corrupt, I think most Americans are beginning to believe that.” He continued: “In China it’s hard to tell what is a private investment in Joe Biden and his son, and what is a government investment and obviously it’d be much more worrisome if the Chinese government were involved in paying Hunter Biden for investing in his fund, but I don’t think it’s beyond the pale of consideration because so many of the companies in China … the government retains a 50% interest in a lot of so-called private entities over there, so yeah, I think we should find out if the Chinese government made an indirect or direct investment in Joe Biden’s son. I think absolutely.” Paul also dismissed suggestions that it was wrong of Trump to ask Ukraine or China to get involved in U.S. politics. He said:\n“Now people want to word this as ‘Oh, getting involved in our political system.’ Well political figures can be corrupt and it doesn’t meant that just because they are a political figure we don’t investigate them.

All of these illegal aliens arrested have final orders for removal, meaning they have gone through the asylum and immigration courts and have been found not to be eligible to stay in the U.S. Compare these deportation numbers to that of Fiscal Year 2018, when ICE deported 2,711 illegal aliens who arrived as family units at the border for the entire year. This indicates that about 226 illegal aliens claiming to be part of a family unit were deported every month last year compared to about 1,250 deported each month in August and September of this year — a more than 453 percent increase in illegal family unit deportations based on monthly totals.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, research finds that deporting the 11 to 22 million illegal aliens saves American taxpayers billions compared to the costs they are forced to pay when illegal aliens are allowed to stay.\n\nDeporting every illegal alien in the country would amount to a cost savings of about $622 billion over the course of a lifetime. This indicates that deporting illegal aliens is six times less costly than what it costs American taxpayers to currently subsidize the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S.\n\nMass deportations are supported by a majority of American voters, a July Harvard/Harris Poll finds.

My heart was racing. I saw how excited my daughter was, and I knew a new chapter was about to begin.” At the beginning of the video, Love holds herself up by leaning on a table, but then lets go and makes her way across the room to another piece of furniture.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been untruthful in telling voters she was fired from a teaching job because she was “visibly pregnant.” As Breitbart News noted Sunday, Warren’s campaign tale was called into question by a 2007 interview in which she suggested she left for lack of qualifications and interest. County records published by the Washington Free Beacon on Monday confirm that Warren resigned and was never fired. The Free Beacon’s Collin Anderson reported: “The Riverdale Board of Education approved a second-year teaching contract for a young Elizabeth Warren, documents show, contradicting the Democratic presidential candidate’s repeated claims that she was asked not to return to teaching after a single year because she was “visibly pregnant.” Minutes of an April 21, 1971, Riverdale Board of Education meeting obtained by the Washington Free Beacon show that the board voted unanimously on a motion to extend Warren a “2nd year” contract for a two-days-per-week teaching job. That job is similar to the one she held the previous year, her first year of teaching. Minutes from a board meeting held two months later, on June 16, 1971, indicate that Warren’s resignation was ‘accepted with regret.’” In fact, the minutes show that far from being fired, Warren had been unanimously approved for a second year. The minutes also confirm a key detail from the 2007 interview: namely, that Warren was hired on an “emergency” basis because she lacked the necessary education qualifications, despite graduating from George Washington University with a degree in speech pathology, and supposedly pursuing a lifelong dream of being a public school teacher.\n\nIn the course of her presidential campaign, Warren has repeatedly told the nation a very different story — one in which an old-fashioned male principal discriminated against her because of her pregnancy.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2c0165abeec31600ae9278dc8fa9cd56/5E4AECA8/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.104.1424.1424a/s640x640/71538841_2448340988581358_2668243046083416891_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3W-kB5H-wQ/", "caption": "🇺🇸So.

As of July 2019, the most current data available, 18,393,979 households and 36,285,397 individuals have participated in the nation’s food stamp program.

Prior to Trump’s inauguration, Bakaj tweeted that “the security of the nation rests with career federal employees (DoD, CIA, etc.) doing the right thing.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6f8f118a26bc825544ee45a988bb5f4e/5E42EF98/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/70183448_417437598956920_8026067206695562619_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3V2muIHZfD/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6048cf895a0741138357a7e80e895f46/5DC1E524/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/73090947_751707528592181_4659371750665585187_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Vicdzns8Q/", "caption": "Breitbart News Entertainment Editor Jerome Hudson speaking at #TPUSA’s 2019 Black Leadership Summit!\n🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸\n@jeromeehudson @turningpointusa #jeromehudson #breitbart #turningpointusa #bls2019 #washingtondc", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/17a0824ccc2dbf874b26b02e9fdd152e/5E55E7CB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c213.0.855.855a/s640x640/70762809_142500060342767_787845488876516010_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VVpZfFWrK/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8c04280d6b974027231835e2e073b08e/5DC16C86/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/71066242_2376863369197506_3406148054913484684_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VNIKEFgGC/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a922fc778fada43ac93be017cfa244e6/5DC1D1D6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71511195_521051945341085_2430543029640426213_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VFviclIlv/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/984f65911badf389641526844b267da3/5DC20C63/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70504645_610280662838543_9198956160806594500_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VD4WsHBc5/", "caption": "🌊 🌊 MOMENTUM: The number of Republicans backing a resolution to condemn Adam Schiff is now up to 73. 🌊 🌊", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d37b6269c4d3fbea03f9a95fed324940/5E4FE24F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.38.1315.1315a/s640x640/71183438_195627161469449_1511400306063625685_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3VB_v9HBB9/", "caption": "😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂SPARTACUS!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f46b64d95c345d67302f46b74e711c0a/5E3EB465/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c57.0.1127.1127a/s640x640/71785157_430211787631539_7139187537212413047_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3U90n4n-wP/", "caption": "Breitbart News Entertainment Editor Jerome Hudson’s book signing at #TPUSA’s 2019 Black Leadership Summit in Washington, D.C.\n🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸\n@jeromeehudson @turningpointusa #jeromehudson #bls2019 #booksigning #breitbart #washingtondc", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e775cff17312ca483a58dbab58936898/5E5BB0E6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c314.0.811.811a/s640x640/70507605_373535346883824_3272339015466247674_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Uspo5n9EK/", "caption": "🔴MAGA Country to Roar Back!🔴 The impeachment effort against President Donald Trump may be popular among Democrats but it has also energized his supporters, including thousands of women who plan to show up at the nation’s capital on October 17 for the March for Trump. “We are coming to Washington to support our president — to stand with him through this impeachment charade,” Amy Kremer, Tea Party activist and founder of Women for America First, the organization behind the march, said on SiriusXM’s @siriusxm Breitbart News Saturday with host Matt Boyle. “[Democrats are] trying to subvert the will of the people and overturn the vote and people are as mad as hell about it,” Kremer said, adding, “It absolutely is a partisan witch hunt and the American people can see right through it.” And Trump’s supporters are taking the effort to remove a duly elected president through a political impeachment process personally. “People see it not just as an attack on the president but an attack on us,” Kremer said. The march, which begins at 10 a.m. at the U.S. Capitol, will include marchers visiting lawmaker’s offices to express their opposition to impeachment, support for Trump and his reelection in 2020, and also a push to take back the House. “[Congress is] there to legislate not to investigate,” Kremer said. “We have to take that gavel out of Nancy Pelosi’s hand.” “The Tea Party did it in 2010 and we have to do it again in 2020 because we need Congress to get back to doing the business of the people,” Kremer said.\n\nKremer said instead of facing a daily assault from Democrats and the media, Trump could be enjoying a leisurely life in the private sector. “Instead he is fighting for this nation; fighting back against corruption,” Kremer said.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/fef664ea4946e72c7973e9b2c716db97/5E5D5F4C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.111.1435.1435a/s640x640/70343459_2494391433987583_8982793518055212762_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3Um_bOn5HC/", "caption": "President Donald Trump criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi late Sunday, suggesting she and Rep.

The poll showed that the recent headlines on Ukraine, surrounding President Donald Trump’s calls for the Bidens to be investigated and the Democrats’ push to impeach him over those calls, are having a negative impact on the former vice president.\n\nThe poll also showed that as a result of the Ukraine issue, eight percent said they were more likely to vote for Biden, while 23 percent said they were more likely to vote against him.\n\nThe former vice president’s son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company and was paid $50,000 a month for no discernible work while his father was tasked with overseeing Ukraine for the White House. The elder Biden had pushed the Ukrainian government to fire a former chief prosecutor, who had opened an investigation into the company’s CEO.\n\nThe Bidens have denied doing anything improper, and the former vice president has denied ever speaking to his son about his work, although conflicting accounts, including from his own son, have emerged, as well as a picture of him, his son, and a Ukrainian gas executive on a golfing trip together.\n\nThe younger Biden also had ties with an investment firm that raised funds in China. He once accompanied his father on a work trip to China and appeared to further those ties during that trip.\n\nThe poll surveyed 900 adults contacted via mobile phones and landlines from September 26 to October 3 and had a 3.3-point margin of error.

While addressing the crowd, the rapper praised President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, who oversaw the abolition of slavery in the United States. “That’s the Republican Party that freed the slaves,” he pointed out. He then hit out at those who have criticized his support for President Trump, saying: “You black, so you can’t like Trump? I ain’t never made a decision based only on my color. That’s a form of slavery, mental slavery.” The rapper’s performance coincided with the 189th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. West made headlines last year when he visited the White House and delivered an enthusiastic 10-minute monologue in the Oval Office as he sat across from President Trump. “Let’s stop worrying about the future. All we really have is today,” he stated, before adding: “Trump is on his hero’s journey right now, and he might not have expected to have a crazy motherf—er like Kanye West.” “I love this guy right here,” West, donning a red “Make America Great Again” hat, said before giving President Trump a long hug.\n\nIn turn, the president praised West’s remarks, calling them “pretty impressive.” “That was quite something,” he added.\n\nWest also made waves during last year’s season premiere of Saturday Night Live in which he defended President Trump, explaining “blacks weren’t always Democrats.” “You know it’s like the plan they did, to take the fathers out the home and put them on welfare.

Biden, who in the past had refused to discuss his son’s business dealings with foreign governments, appeared perturbed by the question. “It’s not a conflict of interest,” the former vice president said. “There’s been no indication of any conflict of interest, from Ukraine or anywhere else, period. I’m not going to respond to that.” The question regarding the potential conflict of interest came only hours after the newly appointed Ukrainian Prosecutor General  announced he was reviewing allegations of criminal conduct against Burisma. Hunter Biden joined the company’s board of directors in April 2014, despitehaving no prior background in either the energy industry or Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book  Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friend, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month, around the same time his father was tapped to lead the Obama administration’s policy in Ukraine.\nThe timing of Hunter Biden’s ascension to Burisma’s board immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe concerning conflicts of interest. Adding to the ethical cloud over that appointment was that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma’s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Many have speculated Hunter Biden’s position on Burisma’s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.\n\nSuch a brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky.

Unemployment was expected to remain unchanged at last month’s 3.7 percent.

Shachtman has a history of making derogatory and inflammatory statements about conservatives, once comparing American conservatives to ISIS.\n\nWithout giving Breitbart a chance to respond, police leaders including Chief Michel Moore (pictured) immediately acquiesced to Shachtman by making false statements about Breitbart, saying via Twitter that the department “celebrates diversity” and that the ad’s appearance on Breitbart “creates a negative juxtaposition to our core values.” In addition to being pro-police and pro-law enforcement, Breitbart maintains a newsroom staff that is more diverse than many mainstream media outlets. Women and minorities serve in key editorial roles at Breitbart.\n\nDespite these facts, which have been confirmed by the New York Times Magazine, the LAPD said it is launching an investigation into how the ad appeared on Breitbart so that it will never happen again. “We take matters like this very seriously, and have begun an initial inquiry into the matter and to determine its validity, as well as what future steps can and will be taken to avoid this situation occurring in the future.” A separate Twitter account @joinLAPD, which appears to be dedicated to police recruitment, said Saturday that the banner ad appearing on Breitbart was a Google ad.

I think we all kind of embrace it as: We’ve got his attention, so we must be doing something right.” MacCallum reportedly added, according to the Hollywood Reporter: “Contrary to the opinion of some people, he’s not our boss.” Since retiring from the House last year, Ryan has said he viewed his resignation as an “escape hatch” and promptly trashed Trump in a book, saying he wanted to “scold him all the time” because Trump “didn’t know anything about government.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/34873d58e4ff6630d502f1d0e690dbd1/5E4A7322/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.104.1424.1424a/s640x640/69875303_435849377046194_310899788164207461_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B26rh1envw6/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b295e8238c5b5e8d565305c1fc2c9100/5E53AA1A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71297648_369850050569556_2788264966521084655_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B26j7cTHLzj/", "caption": "🔴 BACKFIRE: Democrats' overreach with their phony impeachment push is flooding GOP campaign coffers with over $13,000,000.00 and rising!🔴", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8c88d345a04fcbeb4155ba55acf330a8/5E62A350/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.101.1420.1420a/s640x640/70497714_484875422063651_2312758519020489063_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B26gl8Pnby1/", "caption": "🔥🔥🔥", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d70fba330d1c513324a55d1a65440f03/5E5B8C40/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70540800_394634354812018_2990537383962250887_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B25RqlJniIw/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9dda470799f12e5ed89b3230d47757ba/5DC1ACCE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/71002231_229044981407419_7499985335284347179_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B25JhbyHWt0/", "caption": "🚨🚨🚨A CIA officer falsely claimed in his so-called “whistleblower” complaint that the Counselor to the U.S. State Department was present during President Donald Trump’s telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to CBS News. According to the complaint released Thursday, the officer claimed Ulrich Brechbuhl listened into the July 25th call between the president and Zelensky and that several State officials were later briefed on the details of their discussion. The nine-page complaint addresses President Trump’s call with Zelensky, in which the president discussed, separately, both U.S. military aid to Ukraine and allegations of potential wrongdoing by Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President and 2020 White House hopeful Joe Biden. While President Trump suggested Zelensky look into the Bidens, the Ukrainian president has vehemently denied being pressured to do so. “I think you read everything. I think you read text. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be involved to democratic open elections, elections of USA. No, sure, we had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things, and I — so I think and you read it that nobody pushed me,” Zelensky, flanked by the president, told reporters at the United Nations.\n\nOn Wednesday, in a nod to transparency, the White House released a transcript of the Trump-Zelensky call at the urging of House and Senate Democrats.\n\nNonetheless, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said the contents of the transcript reaffirm the need to begin a formal impeachment probe. “Either the President does not know the weight of his words or he does not care about ethics or his constitutional responsibilities,” Pelosi said. “The transcript and the Justice Department’s acting in a rogue fashion in being complicit in the President’s lawlessness confirm the need for an impeachment inquiry. Clearly, the Congress must act.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/645500beb63dc446c7ec078d06cee437/5E433507/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.110.1432.1432a/s640x640/69790792_177191230109890_6522684288367269177_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B25GynAnCN-/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/341b0b13762dc9b417132cbcabb9601d/5DC1E506/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/69601132_121157572614448_5959175831035847139_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B243jgcHaci/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ef6dacca519a40498aa9a7588d669751/5E58D81E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71211207_396677794347264_6120355502107396502_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B24yBSYHyvs/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/43ff9d4f8a4e59f66f1840f182f6d24c/5DC18911/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71186041_2553707981391843_1969166605399366714_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B24tfD7HZTd/", "caption": "🤡 Pencil Neck Performs Improv! 🤡 House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) performed an entirely made-up conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky during his opening statement at a committee hearing Thursday morning.\n\nThe White House released a transcript of a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on Wednesday, but Schiff made up and fabricated his own transcript that he read at the hearing, which sought to create the quid pro quo that Democrats have accused the president of making. “This is the essence of what the president communicates,” Schiff began. “We’ve been very good to your country.

The revelation comes after Integrate filed a suit against James Biden and Platinum Global Partners in June, claiming they never followed through on a promise to investment $3 million into the company. The suit is similar to one filed in Tennessee against James Biden in which the former vice president’s brother is accused of defrauding a rural healthcare company. Unlike the Tennessee suit, however, the Integrate suit marks the first mention of the Biden Cancer Initiative — a non-profit set up by the former vice president after leaving the White House. In June, the organization, which did not fund cancer research but rather convened major institutions to work on the issue, suspended its operations indefinitely after questions were raised about the influence its donors would have on Biden were he to be elected president in 2020.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5a055a9c3d67810d24205847f77e8223/5E563D21/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.176.1440.1440a/s640x640/71190246_458400178098417_629902132277918517_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B24DarUnCXI/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a0a08c4dba90feee24e9e39935ed3c5a/5E40F6CE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69511376_385126472183657_1980838685845114353_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B23EytsH_9R/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/381ae2a42136b023db5bcc66aca62857/5DC1752B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/69674839_482143649298677_5212390440248128286_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B227FKDHx-w/", "caption": "President Trump’s campaign announced on Wednesday that it – along with the Republican National Committee – raised $5 million in the 24 hours following House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) formal announcement of an impeachment inquiry. “In the 24 hours since news of Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment announcement, @realDonaldTrump’s campaign & @GOP have BLOWN OUT fundraising!” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale announced on Twitter.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/26028e82e2699eb94e9cf4d00b3b12ad/5E6032BD/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.121.1440.1440a/s640x640/71312154_157411608693709_1295098917823230797_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B220qK0nuv0/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b3882484cec8e41c0441c7ff07b8e600/5DC17495/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70788906_1696973537099547_3708134215576882817_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B22ttxIHz_U/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2f21a0973033b86638ddb2f03f32efcc/5DC11A03/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69843236_136793334301082_9150172318413403688_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B22lYzNnb4J/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/038fad9a1fa47f0acecf4ba9d78c84e1/5DC20151/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69510423_170339787439596_3170372815146656438_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B22dMXLgse9/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b063e97b9e3fab799891d5869ab3428c/5DC11510/t51.2885-15/e15/c0.237.612.612a/70418810_665750800600133_6031564542275311462_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B22dxTyngLJ/", "caption": "⬛️⬛️ Mystery: Why was Hunter Biden being paid $83,000.00 a month by Urkanian energy company Burisma when he had no background in energy while his father Joe Biden was Vice President and the point man on Ukraine-US policy?⬛️⬛️ The hefty salary that Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden’s youngest son, drew while serving on the board of directors of a Ukrainian oil and gas giant is raising questions not only about his role with the company, but also about if he profited from his father’s political influence.\n\nThe younger Biden, who has a history of getting rich from entities tied to his father, is at center of controversy after President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government look into his business dealings in the country. Although the former vice president has attempted to paint the issue as an abuse of power on Trump’s part, many have noted the unanswered questions surrounding his son’s tenure at Burisma points to serious conflict of interests, if not outright corruption. The most prominent and perplexing question is how and why Hunter Biden was appointed to the company’s board of directors in the first place. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book, Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden had no prior experience with either the energy industry or Ukraine before joining Burisma in April 2014. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to current and past members of the company’s board of directors. At the time of his appointment, ethics watchdogs highlighted the younger Biden’s lack of qualifications but were more concerned about the appearance of a conflict of interest. In particular, many worried Hunter Biden’s ascension to the board of directors, a position that paid at times more than $83,000 per month, was related to his father’s position as the Obama administration’s point man on Ukraine.", "img_url":

collusion with Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign — collusion later found not to exist.\n\nThe demand, which came from U.S. Senators Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), resurfaced Wednesday in an opinion piece written by conservative Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post. Ironically, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) declared Tuesday that the mere possibility that President Trump had asked Ukraine to continue an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden — even without a quid pro quo — was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry. (Biden boasted in 2018 that he had forced Ukraine to remove its prosecutor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid; he did not tell his audience at the Council on Foreign Relations that the prosecutor was looking into a firm on whose board his son, Hunter Biden, was serving.) The Democrats’ letter is available online. In it, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy demanded that the Ukrainian government answer their questions about the Mueller probe, and issued an implied threat: “This reported refusal to cooperate with the Mueller probe also sends a worrying signal — to the Ukrainian people as well as the international community — about your government’s commitment more broadly to support justice and the rule of law.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/963d1e71a2515a05aa519f492c8360c2/5E63FF6D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.111.1433.1433a/s640x640/69482273_815646385518999_4785564847191118238_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B20O6gqnpPS/", "caption": "***BREAKING*** Ed Henry of Fox News reported Tuesday evening on Hannity that the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General found that the so-called “whistleblower” who raised concerns about President Donald Trump’s discussions with foreign leaders had a “political bias” in favor of one of Trump’s rivals in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe inspector general’s report has, thus far, been withheld by the administration. Democrats allege that the Trump administration is violating the law in keeping the report from Congress, which was the chief reason cited Tuesday by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for changing her mind and supporting an impeachment inquiry. It is not clear why the administration had withheld the report, though the White House announced Tuesday that it will release the report Wednesday, along with the transcript of Trump’s conversation with the new president of Ukraine. Henry, citing a “senior official” with first-hand knowledge of the inspector general’s report, said that the anonymous “whistleblower” — who did not hear Trump’s conversation directly — was biased in favor of one of Trump’s 2020 opponents, though the official did not say which one.\n\nHenry also said the official had told him that there would be no “smoking gun” in the transcript of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — even though there would be “at least a few words” in it that would cause unspecified problems for the White House.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2dbfe37f2432cb56c70d959b156b622a/5E5EDDE5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.114.1439.1439a/s640x640/69405294_2434033853476821_8522340846894589713_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B20LtHZHA78/", "caption": "***OPEN DISCUSSION THREAD***", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5c83a2c625b5d043e154dfc0c7353e39/5E4E4D89/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69314032_369858820588697_78391725494705947_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2zxatdnnlM/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6cae818862b342fee7e5b4f219a7d366/5DC1F0DB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69581799_242043690042859_7461507173419450514_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2zwsoonvFF/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9f38fa45e5ae3dca19885e4998d67323/5DC11523/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/71853535_487547038695734_195804543825203985_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2zpWQVny1Z/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4cc70d6e143d7aa695e218998b00b87a/5DC1EA4F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70963624_763518387447307_8363122067892735880_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2zormDn2CL/", "caption": "***OPEN DISCUSSION THREAD***", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f177402035c72c2739e1b69bb64f3a5c/5E59356F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69742122_758835237890911_4385221087647936558_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2znMOzHa_C/", "caption": "@charliekirk1776", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1954b72dba7b0bed6b9ce9c66e23bffd/5E605D46/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70088780_137675740845057_962006743387780438_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2zmDIEn_Vb/", "caption": "🚨🚨🚨BREAKING🚨🚨🚨 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Tuesday will announce a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump in the wake of his interest in the business dealings of former vice president Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, in Ukraine, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nThis story is developing.

And I expect that President Obama, if he had known about the reality of this situation, would have probably told Biden, “Get rid of this.

Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, scientists were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts. “Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the declaration states. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.” The scientists underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts. “There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,” they declared. “However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly.

Yet this issue has forced me, all over again, to wrestle through a church issue that every Christian must eventually confront. How should we respond when our brothers and sisters are behaving badly?\n\nFor those of us who are Christian, our calling in life transcends our secular obligations. The secular world asks us to conform to a set of rules that are designed to preserve order and civil society. Regardless of any faith or ideology, a sort of mechanical obedience is required and indeed enforced by the rule of law.\n\nThings are not so simple on the Christian side. Here, the calling is greater and more comprehensive: we are bound by the example that Christ both lived and taught — a bar so high in fact, that only the divine can achieve it. And still we are called to it anyways, a standard much higher than it is for simple, good citizenship. From Protestants to Catholics and Orthodox, we all share the belief that to  approach our daily lives rightly means we to ask ourselves: what would Jesus do? \nAnd perhaps nothing is as difficult, or painful, than to watch as the professing faithful behave incongruently with the teachings of Jesus.\n\nFull disclaimer: Jerry Falwell, Jr., has become a personal friend of mine over the past couple of years, and in May I received an honorary doctorate from Liberty at their commencement ceremony. I have the utmost respect for the educational approach and values that emanate from the university’s leadership, and which translate throughout the university. **Read the rest on Breitbart.com...***", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/31015c62e6da34996d45d4ac782dbfec/5E4C6127/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.36.1311.1311a/s640x640/70012264_167075977745351_8534837046376584427_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2y-k8bHeyO/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b8ff79f46a4e5fbeb10131a5558aeb71/5E5AF139/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71179462_399065830754878_3223423856224985342_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2y3NZ0HWYe/", "caption": "Leftist Hollywood figures showered praise on Swedish teen climate change celebrity Greta Thunberg on Monday as she addressed the United Nations General Assembly chided world and warning that the planet is in the “beginning of a mass extinction.” “This fear and pain is real.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this year, Biden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son’s role.) Conservatives claim Biden obstructed justice to protect his son — who enriched himself using his father’s prestige. It is not clear what law, if any, Trump would have broken by urging the Ukrainian government to re-open the case. The alleged “whistleblower” in the case did not hear his conversations with Ukrainian leaders directly, and the Wall Street Journal has suggested there was no quid pro quo — that Trump did not offer (or withhold) anything in return.\n\nNevertheless, the story has given new enthusiasm to supporters of impeachment in the House Democratic caucus, who had been somewhat deflated after Special Counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of Russian collusion.\n\nIn July, the House voted 332-95 to postpone an impeachment resolution. As of last week, the Democrats only had 175 votes for impeachment from their 235 member — 43 votes short of the 218 necessary for a House majority. Almost all of the Democratic presidential contenders support impeachment, but only 37% of the public support it, while half oppose impeachment, according to the most recent Politico/Morning Consult poll released last week.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4c1672160afcc450fd8ac1ab9e8032cd/5E5E8882/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.36.1311.1311a/s640x640/71530679_661491814336558_6984169514181588676_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2xwFrFniT3/", "caption": "@gretathunberg", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6cf5b667af0915c555d960b2150106c0/5E62D2D0/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69319874_1099351820258338_8401182070135368167_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2xnaJunZq4/", "caption": "🎉🎉🎉 Congratulations, Democrats!

Omar’s criticism of Biden came after delivering a keynote address at the Iowa People’s Presidential Forum, an event organized by several progressive organizations, in which she argued the United States needs a president who “realizes we are not just fighting for one election; we are fighting for the very soul of our democracy and what society we want to become.” Several Democrat presidential candidates —including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg — attended the gathering.\n\nThe far-left “Squad” member is not the only lawmaker in the four-person clique to raise concerns about Biden’s bid for the White House.

However, according to the New York Democrat, the former Veep’s plan is too little, too late. “Scientifically, anything that is less than helping us cut carbon emissions in half by 2030 is going to be too late,” she said. “It’s a start, and I think that what that has shown is a dramatic shift in the right direction, but we need to keep pushing for a plan that is at the scale of the problem.” Ocasio-Cortez also previously knocked Biden’s performance at the first Democratic presidential debate, saying it “raised questions” about his capacity to be commander-in-chief.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dde45bda6391470bedf64af6fe2984a5/5E60C565/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.39.1316.1316a/s640x640/70574751_155428785521758_5494858136185296869_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2wPsvwnUSp/", "caption": "Climate activist groups plan to “Shut Down D.C.” early Monday morning, aiming “to take action all over the district to disrupt business as usual.” The protest follows a weekend of climate strikes across the country and coincides with the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.

This is an exceptional honor.” Hawkins previously won the Journalist of the Year Award in 2015 and 2017 and won Gun Rights Defender of the Year in 2016.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3de0aaf1cca56cd1489766fa762df911/5E489453/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.159.1440.1440a/s640x640/71962336_192798475078019_7893809242663837104_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2sY6TWHEnC/", "caption": "⬛️WHEN WILL THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATE JOE & HUNTER BIDEN?⬛️", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5db450cc79be82c6535763c71ea468ab/5E42E979/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69593254_453649845493818_5453627163357679309_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2sYqvnnQtZ/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/12cd9010c3f0b5a2143fcbc1ee61d069/5E60255D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70606724_368140147427799_5170664156731176852_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2sO_zeHWA0/", "caption": "🚨🚨🚨🚨 The anonymous whistleblower who claimed that President Donald Trump pressured the Ukraine’s head of state to investigate Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden didn’t have direct knowledge of what was said, according to a new report.\n\nCNN‘s Stephen Collinson reported Friday that the whistleblower “didn’t have direct knowledge of the communications,” citing an official briefed on the matter: “Instead, the whistleblower’s concerns came in part from learning information that was not obtained during the course of their work, and those details have played a role in the administration’s determination that the complaint didn’t fit the reporting requirements under the intelligence whistleblower law, the official said.” CNN buried the revelation 22 paragraphs into the article titled, “New revelations deepen scandal over Trump whistleblower complaint.” The new revelation complicates the accusations against the president, which first surfaced in the Wall Street Journal this week. The newspaper reported that an anonymous whistleblower claimed President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani to look into Hunter Biden’s business dealings with Ukraine during a phone call in July.\n\nThe report said the business dealings were between Hunter Biden and an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch while Joe Biden was Vice President. Trump has defended himself against the allegations, calling the whistleblower’s statements “highly partisan” in a tweet on Friday. He also called the accusations another “witch hunt” in a separate tweet on Saturday. “Now that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone ‘bust’ on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden,” the president tweeted.\n“Will fail again!”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/54ba642079c2201c7cd8bb9de7fcab35/5E493A64/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69840433_903788046663041_229103442271123910_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2sM_yInRUZ/", "caption": "***OPEN DISCUSSION THREAD***", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ac2816e93eebc66ef78fd52563f0448a/5E63018E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69695086_660302081408170_667719636732205243_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2sITc0ndb2/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/237f3c349b0f15d4ce861f9279e3c43d/5E45A749/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69463504_2325468034433746_2498274070028497225_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2sBn9VHX2G/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/02045da5f2e22c4e65f4d2e7df095c60/5DC19A39/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69356866_2394534214162755_5913946303712540140_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ryIE8H5Ik/", "caption": "🔶Ya think?🔷", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d1d6e3380b9c270129ecbdf51adfa8cf/5E4DC2F2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.115.1440.1440a/s640x640/70505325_133985434554665_5280955899593521520_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2rjxmen5_i/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ea1687599743164a5c43904de07ef3cc/5DC17EA0/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69922560_610831639322046_6066150423455979796_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2qRen7H6S_/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bfd91a0e80d8e16f1e1ee8e13bfb36ce/5DC1CC7C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/69706977_531536927388973_6044611111191791983_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2qNWfCHiHV/", "caption": "💥💥💥💥", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/86535bf6b69a60487506f6bf4c8dc951/5E571EF1/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.42.1320.1320a/s640x640/70246540_118791715909698_376086533170165344_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2qKla-HFum/", "caption": "#climatestrike #fridaysforfuture", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8b3a25a36dc5642e2f94a2e2a3449243/5E61E990/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69724455_188207655544129_1260982076043552119_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2qHzEBnLol/", "caption": "First Lady Melania Trump @flotus and President Trump greeted Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his wife, Jennifer Morrison, at the White House on Friday for a state dinner.\n📷: AP/Getty/AFP", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2d7d92fc726b07c854a1dddfb2457d40/5E57CE98/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69228444_427151441334408_2221341725114421704_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2qGPjwn0mm/", "caption": "A woman carrying a Glock pistol appeared at a Beto O’Rourke rally in Colorado on Thursday, challenging him for his comment about taking AR-15s and AK-47s from American gun owners. “Gun-owning Americans who heard your speech and heard what you had to say regarding ‘Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15s and AK-47s’ — Well, I am here to say, ‘Hell no, you’re not,’” Lauren Boebert, owner of Shooters Grill, which encourages staff to carry a firearm at work, challenged. O’Rourke’s supporters booed her speech, shouting, “Bullshit” as she said it was “not the gun,” but the “heart of the man” that pulled the trigger. The woman said she lived in Colorado during the Aurora theater shooting and the Columbine shooting. She also said she had four children, was only five feet tall, and could not defend herself from a threat with only her fists.\n\nOne man questioned why the woman needed an AR-15. “I don’t have my AR-15 today. I have my Glock,” she replied. “Well, you shouldn’t have it,” the man replied. “Don’t worry, sir. I have your back,” she replied.\n\nThe woman told O’Rourke that more laws against guns would only prevent law-abiding citizens from owning weapons, as criminals did not obey the laws.\n\nO’Rourke disputed the idea that Americans had to accept the fate of gun deaths at the hands of people. “There’s this presumption that we are, I guess, inherently evil,” he said, “because you ask how we are going to legislate this.” He said Americans should not accept the fate of mass shootings, arguing that no other country allowed citizens to purchase “weapons designed for war.” “This is the criteria that makes sense to me,” O’Rourke replied. “If that weapon was designed to kill people and does so effectively, efficiently, then we should no longer be selling it to each other.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/86bdd652bbf91d49a54a3c6dd568bbd6/5E4389C1/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69304347_428564341102818_2848026290236105253_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2pXfasnEuK/", "caption": "Failed 2016 White House hopeful Hillary Clinton accused President Donald Trump on Friday of seeking the assistance of a foreign government to win a presidential election for a second time. “The president asked a foreign power to help him win an election.

I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,” he said at the time. The former secretary of state’s comment came in response to an interview in which Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney, told CNN that he requested the Ukrainian government to probe possible wrongdoing which may have involved former vice president and 2020 frontrunner Joe Biden. “I didn’t ask them to look into Joe Biden,” Giuliani told host Christopher Cuomo on Thursday. “I asked them to look into the allegations that related to my client, which, tangentially, involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme, not unlike what he did in China.” In 2016, Biden, according to the New York Times, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukrainian prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko was removed. Lutsenko was probing possible wrongdoing of an energy firm of which Biden’s son, Hunter, was a board member.\n\nLast month, Giuliani revealed he spoke to a Ukrainian official about Biden’s potential role in the prosecutor’s removal. “The only thing I asked about Joe Biden is to get to the bottom of how it was that Lutsenko … dismissed the case against [Ukrainian’s Anti-Corruption Action Centre],” he said.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/52b87bd5da7ed2dd7f7129ebc8550997/5E592528/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.116.1440.1440a/s640x640/69480943_133081587995228_7177425089010481698_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2pXIKxnJf1/", "caption": "President Donald Trump repeatedly urged Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to look into former vice president Joe Biden’s son — Hunter Biden — and his business dealings in the eastern European country, according to a Wall Street Journal report. “He told him that he should work with [Mr. Giuliani] on Biden, and that people in Washington wanted to know” whether allegations were true or not, one of the people said.

A Ukrainian official earlier this year said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son.\n\nAfter the July call between the two presidents, the Ukrainian government said Mr. Trump had congratulated the new president on his election and expressed hope that his government would push ahead with investigations and corruption probes that had stymied relations between the two countries.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/438abf3b31a720aa34484c2050c88e3d/5E525CC4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.36.1311.1311a/s640x640/69381475_415563185830823_8054213254960485451_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2pLgaJHkM4/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/81dc20453fcbd30572ccf0540d13c251/5DC1C66F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/69485126_158461218594600_7742569313529665961_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2pJ1_PHtKp/", "caption": "🤪🤪🤪RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!!🤯🤯🤯", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ae57acffa15a3e2fc00a6dd7a515c7a9/5E4C4FE2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/70839714_2665433733544340_4759446650866945838_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2o-rKZn7mC/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1123bf1f3cf40d8c12181f5226f74267/5DC18096/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69489974_511933836038335_8646923239048167083_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ow1kQHfDg/", "caption": "🤣🔥🤣🔥🤣🔥 @justinpjtrudeau", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4e205948b378de6778839206681e5849/5E62A5AC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69371842_377744749588811_5359256226169801734_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oq-L5n8hF/", "caption": "Irvine Valley College students Lloyd Vincent Labriaga @regularlloyd and Kyro Beshay @kyroforprez told Breitbart News that they recently started a brand new Turning Point USA group on their campus, and have already been subjected to harassment by people on campus — one of whom is believed to be a professor — just a few weeks into the fall 2019 semester. Labriaga and Beshay spoke to host Alex Marlow @marlownews in a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s @siriusxm Breitbart News Daily for the show’s weekly TPUSA campus report segment. “We weren’t sure initially when that man approached us, [if he] was actually a professor, but we know for a fact that we were actually being recorded by [a professor],” said Beshay, who is the vice president of the new TPUSA @turningpointusa group on campus. According to both Labriaga and Beshay, a man believed to be a professor approached the conservative students — while they were recruiting members for their TPUSA group — and told the students that they would never “get laid.” Meanwhile, a professor recorded the incident. “We assumed this person was a professor based on an anonymous source that works at IVC,” added Labriaga, who is the TPUSA chapter president. “They basically gave us a list of professors to be mindful of — because of their very radical beliefs, and that they might actually penalize us academically.” Labriaga and Beshay said they initially reacted to the incident by attempting to engage the man in a discussion, but that he was not interested. The students later reported the harassment to the school’s dean, in hopes that his behavior “will be corrected.” “The reason why we had approached the dean,” said Beshay, “is because that sort of behavior is really unacceptable, but it’s something we saw a lot of at that [recruiting] session — we’ve had a lot of people come up to us with conflicting opinions — voicing them in a way that you would not [use] in an actual debate.” The students added that the individual in question — along with two other professors — maintain a blog, which they use to lambaste conservatives and Christians.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/29d6b0cdc4f112ed9ce152fcee06ba6e/5E48A993/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69629762_391435885067163_2682201375618351104_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ojERbnVay/", "caption": "#climatestrike #fridaysforfuture", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/019338c9d1f46e0f8de51d93a857a9b2/5E555F4A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69465887_487758471774201_110654118347043867_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ogMmAHrcU/", "caption": "🔥🤣🔥🤣🔥🤣🔥", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c08222b521244004edb71e2cee9333f2/5E594267/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69042020_284075125884732_6291035316320059159_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oeikPHBVc/", "caption": "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dd838e2c9385dec968354a4bd9dbfc07/5E654C92/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.33.1305.1305a/s640x640/69648167_431449254159989_8284719929694866380_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2oXkZ-Hdz7/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bb140e451e1751aa09dc2bbef7db5c00/5E4CDD17/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69714513_390752081614558_681182150640830479_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2nhiJYHMel/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/26b850e07383db28b69fb51f17fd1488/5DC16A7B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/70122138_708511899560694_133287996092315364_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2nJGn9HNXS/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1f5ae5889fc1f545dcaa712f98583264/5E5BA34F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69481244_107354497196558_7950684234952580502_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2nHlOinnzs/", "caption": "Leftist activist Bette Midler @bettemidler announced her hopes that a “bee hive” would fuck up President Donald Trump, and fantasized about Beyonce mobilizing to defeat Trump in 2020. “Beyoncé has 133 million Instagram followers,” Bette Midler said. “More than double the people who voted for Trump.

If she doesn’t like your politics, she wants you killed, crippled, or otherwise seriously harmed.\n\nFor years the 72-year-old actress has hit Twitter to indulge her violent and blood-soaked fantasies of death.\n\nMidler has, for instance, tweeted hopes for the president’s death many times. To cite just a few examples, in June she tweeted and deleted her fantasy that Trump would be stabbed to death. Last year she hoped to see Donald Trump’s funeral on TV. And also last year she expressed her desire to “hang” Trump and his whole family, perhaps even the then 12-year-old Barron Trump.\n\nThere has been no reply from Beyoncé’s camp as of yet. The “Say My Name” singer, who has endorsed Beto O’Rourke’s doomed campaign for Senate in Texas, is no stranger to political activism.

President Trump traveled to the southwest earlier this week to view progress on the border wall. “Now, the wall still, obviously, has a ways to go, but we’re building it at a breakneck speed,” he said Wednesday in San Diego during a press conference. Hoffman also announced Thursday that nearly all of the $2.5 billion military counter-drug money that was allocated to the border wall in February has been obligated and is now on contract, and that the rest of that money, $3 million, would be obligated next week. That $2.5 billion will go towards border projects in New Mexico, Arizona, and California. “That is going to build 129 miles of wall — all of that money is on contract as of — I think there’s $3 million left — and that’ll be by the end of next week.

Time magazine, which published the photo, revealed that Trudeau wore the politically incorrect outfit to an “Arabian Nights” party at a private school where he worked as a teacher. The photo was featured in the school’s yearbook, where students could see and potentially emulate his behavior. Trudeau was 29 years old at the time the photo was taken — far older than other political figures who have apologized for racist behavior in their adolescence.\n\nFollowing the publication of the photo, Trudeau revealed that he had donned blackface in high school to perform Harry Belafonte’s “Banana Boat Song (Day O).” A photo later surfaced of a young Trudeau in a 1970s outfit, Afro wig, and dark skin paint. The outfit did not appear to be a costume intended to look like Harry Belafonte. Canada’s CBC broadcaster referred to the image as “makeup” on Twitter and rapidly corrected to the proper term, “blackface.” Trudeau does not appear to have made the same correction at the time of this writing. In a transcript of his remarks to reporters on Wednesday by the Toronto Star – which the Star notes omit his comments in French, though it does not indicate that they deviated significantly from what he said in English – Trudeau refers twice to wearing “makeup,” without ever describing it as “blackface” or “brownface.” “I attended an end-of-year gala where the theme was Arabian nights. I dressed up in Aladdin costume and put makeup on. I shouldn’t have done that. I should have known better, but I didn’t.

The president traveled via motorcade after a fundraiser to Otay Mesa, a community outside San Diego on the United States -Mexico border to review the latest constructed physical barrier.\n\nHe pointed out the new wall structure to the press, which was 24 miles of primary and secondary wall at the border. “We have it covered underground, we have it covered overground,” Trump said.\nThe president was joined by acting Department of Homeland security Kevin McAllen and several other border security officials. He said that over 44,000 bollard panels had been set up for the wall, which was then filled with concrete and rebar.\n\nTrump admitted that he envisioned a solid concrete wall when he campaigned for president, but he was told by border officials that they preferred a wall constructed by concrete-filled bollards so they could see through it. “It’s hardened concrete, very powerful concrete,” Trump said, pointing to the structure.  He added that the steel wall was designed to retain heat, making it harder to climb, plus having an anti-climbing system at the top. “You can fry an egg on that wall,” e said. The president also acknowledged to reporters that he wanted the wall to be painted black and have spikes but said it was cheaper to let it remain naturally rust-colored. “We can paint it later,” he said.\n\nThe president discussed his growing understanding of border barriers, noting that the Southern border would not need much more than 500 miles of wall to secure the border.

While the Democrat presidential candidates tailor their messages to the sensibilities of white uber-liberals, President Trump is running for re-election on a record of delivering unprecedented opportunity and prosperity to African-Americans.\n\nLeft-leaning commentators have begun to notice that the political views of white Democrats are now significantly to the left of the opinions held by the Party’s black voters on a wide range of topics. The Democratic Party has undergone a massive leftward lurch during the Trump era, but this embrace of far-left extremism has been driven almost exclusively by its far-left, mostly-white fringe. Black voters, who represent about a quarter of the entire Democrat electorate, are finding themselves increasingly out of step with a Party establishment that is rapidly abandoning traditional liberal values in favor of radical proposals that would completely upend American society. This is borne out by recent polling. Nearly 70 percent of black Democrats, for instance, insist that candidates must explain their plans to create jobs, compared to only 39 percent of white Democrats. When the Democrat presidential candidates mention job creation on the campaign trail, however, they usually do so as an afterthought, or else they cite grossly inflated projections of job creation in an effort to justify their plans to spend trillions of taxpayer dollars on big-government boondoggles, such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All. That approach may be all it takes to satisfy most white liberals, but it gives short shrift to one of the primary concerns shared by a huge proportion of African American voters.\n\nSimilarly, 55 percent of black Democrats say they would only consider voting for candidates who propose plans to reduce taxes, compared to only 25 percent of white Democrats...Read the rest at Breitbart.com.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1ce67a29cf1bd6627b2fb1a09a757b3f/5E48FBFF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69784652_386557858705308_52151731561114885_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2kCKZlHTFY/", "caption": "🔷Democrat Party activist Taylor Swift is ready to go all in for 2020.🔷 Pop superstar and left-wing activist Taylor Swift @taylorswift has admitted to becoming “obsessed” with progressive politics and claims she is now “really focused” on helping Democrats defeat President Donald Trump and Republican candidates in the 2020 election cycle.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Swift spoke of how she has come to obsess over politics since her political adversaries have started winning elections. “I keep trying to learn as much as I can about politics, and it’s become something I’m now obsessed with, whereas before, I was living in this sort of political ambivalence because the person I voted for had always won,” she explained. “I think a lot of people are like me, where they just didn’t really know that this could happen. But I’m just focused on the 2020 election,” the Grammy-winner said. “I’m really focused on it. I’m really focused on how I can help and not hinder. Because I also don’t want it to backfire again, because I do feel that the celebrity involvement with Hillary’s campaign was used against her in a lot of ways.” One of Swift’s proposals for helping defeat Trump in 2020 is that Democrats work as a team and rally behind their eventual candidate, something many on the left of the party refused to do after Hillary Clinton won the presidential nomination against Bernie Sanders in dubious circumstances. “I do think, as a party, we need to be more of a team,” the “Shake It Off” crooner argued. “With Republicans, if you’re wearing that red hat, you’re one of them. And if we’re going to do anything to change what’s happening, we need to stick together. “We need to stop dissecting why someone’s on our side or if they’re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly.

As Yale Daily News put it: “In 1994, Kavanaugh joined the legal team, led by Kenneth Starr, that was looking into President Bill Clinton’s real estate dealings as part of the Whitewater investigation. Later that decade, Kavanaugh co-wrote the Starr Report, which established broad grounds for Clinton’s impeachment.\n\nThose proceedings pitted Kavanaugh against a former Yale classmate, Max Stier ’87, a fellow member of Stiles College who was one of several attorneys representing Clinton during the investigation.” The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway noted in a piece that during those proceedings Stier had “worked closely with David Kendall,” who would later defend Hillary Clinton against allegations of illegally handling classified information. Stier once worked for a Republican congressman decades ago — Rep. Jim Leach (R-IA) in 1982, but he would later donate to Democrats. He donated $250 to the Democratic National Committee in 2000 while he worked at Housing and Urban Development, and then donated about $1,000 to former President Barack Obama in 2007 and 2008, according to the Federal Election Commission website. In 2004, Stier, then divorced, married then-assistant U.S. attorney Florence Yu Pan, according to a New York Times wedding announcement. The wedding took place in Washington, D.C.\n\nThat same year, a person by the name of “Florence Pan” in Washington, D.C., donated $500 to John Kerry’s campaign for president.\n\nPan was later nominated by President Obama to be a federal judge for the Washington, D.C., U.S. District Court in April 2016, but the nomination expired before the Senate could vote on it.

Sending thoughts and prayers in the wake of disasters is “controversial,” said Linda Thunström, an economist at the University of Wyoming who co-authored the study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study, based on interaction with some 400 residents in North Carolina following Hurricane Florence’s destruction in 2018, said that atheists and agnostics are “prayer averse” — willing to pay to avoid receiving prayers — and are especially against receiving thoughts and prayers “from Christians.” Nonreligious people “were willing to pay about $1.66 to avoid a prayer from a priest and more than double that price at $3.54 to avoid one from a Christian stranger,” CNN stated. “The last result is surprising because one might expect that atheists/agnostics would be indifferent to people praying for them — why care, if you don’t believe in the gesture?” said Thunström. “But that is not what we find — atheists and agnostics are averse to prayers,” she said, and are willing to pay money in order “not to get a prayer from a Christian stranger.” “Hence, it is important to think about who the target person is when sending thoughts and prayers in the wake of hardship,” she said. Along with the emotional aversion that atheists and agnostics may experience to prayers said for the, critics also argue “that these gestures are meaningless and can reduce material help or structural reforms aimed at mitigating natural and social disasters,” the study said.\n\nSome have included the phrase “I’ll pray for you” in lists of micro-aggressions, suggesting that this expression can “communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights and insults toward people.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/70688dca7e5540785e740dd9a9e77c75/5E4D385D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.36.1311.1311a/s640x640/70875305_369744730603232_2898750409437881736_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2h2ZQKH13F/", "caption": "The friend of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford reportedly said the story of the alleged assault “didn’t make any sense” and claimed she was threatened with a smear campaign if she did not support it.\n\nFord said her high school friend, Leland Keyser, was at the party that took place in 1982 when she claims Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her.

The DACA illegal aliens, represented by Georgetown Law’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection (ICAP), want a preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of the public charge rule while the case goes through the courts, calling an end to welfare-dependent immigration “discriminatory” and suggesting the rule is racist against non-white immigrants. “The new rule would allow immigration officials to deny [Lawful Permanent Resident] status to many immigrants in an arbitrary and discriminatory way,” Amy Marshak, senior counsel at ICAP, said in a statement. “This is by design. President Trump and his advisors have expressed animus toward non-white immigrants, and studies already have shown that the new rule will disproportionately affect immigrants of color.” The lawsuit seeks to ensure that DACA illegal aliens, who have lobbied for DACA amnesty for years, would be able to obtain green cards if such an amnesty is granted despite them having used welfare that U.S. taxpayers have been forced to pay for.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8b3b936fdd9e06f685416806601bb31b/5E3FFF66/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.115.1440.1440a/s640x640/68837585_672977906535110_2876301268354563157_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2fgCQ3H9Ma/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b4fde0dd2b0ed8e48201b436061d6b5b/5DC1EFF7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/69651976_736562016767421_1782258572900583364_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2fauQtH7BG/", "caption": "🇺🇸⚾️🇺🇸⚾️🇺🇸⚾️🇺🇸⚾️", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7f5215c8645f9db93ffdbec35bacda96/5E55B9FF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70520347_2460616327513400_5957853283020114743_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2fQQ-lHVvy/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/087a6b218f711c96338f711ba3cee544/5DC10745/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/69525277_413730345787380_1300473039556603860_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2fRKBRnIKA/", "caption": "⚾️ LEGEND ⚾️ President Donald Trump honored Major League Baseball’s Mariano Rivera with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Monday. “I’m proud to be an American,” Rivera said as the president bestowed the award.

On August 17, 2019, O’Rourke tweeted about visiting a gun show in Arkansas. One of the photos he tweeted showed a sign advertising AR-15s for $395. O’Rourke used his time at the September 12, 2019, Democrat debate to make clear his plans to take AR-15s from Americans, saying, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15.” Alpha Dog Firearms responded by running a special in which it sold AR-15s even cheaper than the $395 price Beto found in Arkansas. It priced them for $349.99, calling it a “Beto Special.” The rifles sold out in less than four hours. Alpha Dog Firearms explained via a Facebook post, “Our $349.99 AR deal sold out in less than 4 hours. We’re trying to process the orders and work on getting more special deals for our good friend gun grabber Beto.” The National Shooting Sports Foundation reported there are more than 16 million privately owned AR-15s in the United States.

The Republican National Committee has released a video of you and it- I want to read you just some of it. You’re comparing migrant shelters to dungeons used about 400 years ago in Ghana that you recently visited. And you toured those caves in Ghana recently. It’s getting a lot of attention. Did you mean, when you were talking there, to compare U.S. border agents to slave traders?\n\nOMAR: So, I’m only controversial because people seem to want to- controversy. What I talked about at our panel that was the plight of black immigrants was about the experience I was having as I went through the dungeons. There were stories that were being told, and I talked about how at that moment I had an image of what’s happening in Libya as- as people as- are being sold. We’ve- we’ve all seen that video, that auction of somebody being sold for 400 dollars. And then I talked about the separation stories that he told about how families were being torn apart, how children were being separated from their parents, how husband and wife would be forcibly separated. And I said that kind of reminded me of what was happening at our border here.\n\nBRENNAN: But you didn’t mean it as an attack on U.S. border agents?\n\nOMAR: Absolutely not. I think this is- this is always the point, right? There is always a- an implied intent to every conversation I have and if you listen to the video, one comparison of what the dungeons looked like and people being sold was to what’s happening in North Africa and the other one was a family separations. And of course we obviously have a- a crisis here with our family separation policies.\n\nBRENNAN: You feel very passionately about immigration.

Breitbart News reported that O’Rourke’s push was a game-changer, proving the left’s goal is gun seizure. The Associated Press noted that Second Amendment Foundation founder Alan Gottlieb welcomed O’Rourke’s push, simply for the damage that it does to the gun control movement. Gottlieb said, “This is what their goal is. We’ve always said it, now they’re saying it. Now they’ve said it and we’re going to make them eat it.” Democrat senators pushing gun control are not happy with O’Rourke’s push. Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) explicitly stated that he does not support the confiscatory push. CNN quoted Coons saying, “I don’t think a majority of the Senate or the country is going to embrace mandatory buybacks.

Pre-order now with link in bio.🔥🔥 BY: Jerome Hudson @jeromeehudson The Democratic Party is the party of slavery. Thanks to the Democrats’ cartoonish clown car of presidential candidates, the party of slavery is now the party of reparations for slavery.\n\nThis stampede of opportunistic dilettantes — conducting self-promotion campaigns posing as presidential bids — have all endorsed Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s (D-TX) resolution, H.R. 40, calling for a commission to “study and develop reparation proposals for African-Americans” and a national apology from the government “for the perpetration of gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity on African slaves and their descendants.” Rep. Lee is not an idiot. Perhaps a quarter century in Washington has convinced her that you are. Why spend millions to fund a Congressional commission to study what we already know to be true? The Democratic Party is the party of slavery.... Is there any wonder than why Democrat.org is missing more than 100 years of history from its history page? The history highlighted on the Democrat’s official party website begins in 1920! This nonsense is why I wrote 50 Things They Don’t Want You to know. \nToday, too many Democrat-run inner cities are black-on-black killing fields. This happened despite the explosion of black social and economic dynamism that began to take form post-World War II. It is also true that we blacks have now spent several decades avoiding turning the spotlight on ourselves. We’ve too often blamed what’s clearly a genocidal self-destruction on racism and faceless societal woes. We’re overwhelmingly responsible for putting each other in body bags; sending each other to the morgue, our bodies riddled with bullets. Yet, the political left insists that we’re not supposed to ask how racism is responsible for that havoc? 🔴Book link in bio🔴", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/481c330afdf474625a11c9fe879a90f5/5E5003E8/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.115.1440.1440a/s640x640/68688339_385604332123088_124867416627470041_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2ZTXekn_Yu/", "caption": "President Donald Trump released a statement Saturday, confirming that the U.S. killed Osama Bin Laden’s son and successor Hamza bin Ladin in a successful counterterrorism operation.\n\nThe counterterrorism operation occurred in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, according to Trump’s statement.

Mendoza told Breitbart News that Facebook justified the removal of the donation button by saying she had “violated their community guidelines more than once.” Mendoza noted that open borders advocacy organizations like United We Dream, funded by billionaire George Soros, are able to obtain donations through Facebook despite routinely attacking the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents for enforcing national immigration law.\n\nFacebook’s removal of Mendoza’s posts and demonetization of her Angel Families page comes less than two months after Twitter banned her from its platform for raising awareness about the American victims of illegal immigration, as Breitbart News reported.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/250a618417eb0084893ac4db6c6d8f87/5E611775/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.114.1439.1439a/s640x640/69044094_140654070521309_1944697216483689143_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2X6GyDHWQq/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1fe4b699bfed70e70646bee2c9f90a13/5DC200F1/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69514232_2403154433278953_6507847874798832748_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2XxDfVnKm_/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0b433ce13d1ed8d12eddb96baa2b9574/5DC1ADF3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/71092117_653829851777328_5589556551397212009_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2XOTbcHoP8/", "caption": "***OPEN DISCUSSION THREAD***", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1a0a63bfd9d4530ad117a178624529ca/5E611F74/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71151248_454341711833120_3277601159678688333_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2XGB7sH4iY/", "caption": "🔶BETO BUSTED🔶  FACT-CHECK CLAIM: There were not enough ambulances available to save the victims of a recent mass shooting in Odessa, Texas.\nVERDICT: FALSE.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) @sentedcruz . The debate was held in Cruz’s Capitol Hill office, where Milano and Fred Guttenberg — whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting in Parkland, Florida — pressed the senator on various gun control proposals. Milano proposed universal background checks, restricting access to AR-15s, and background checks for bullet purchases, while insisting, “We all believe in the Second Amendment.” Despite that claim, she pleaded, “We have to try everything, and figure out what works. Isn’t that worth it?” Around 13 minutes into the discussion, Guttenberg said he was offended by Cruz’s argument that these gun controls would erode Americans’ rights to self-defense. “That’s a load of BS,” he said. “Nobody’s trying to remove your right to self-defense.” “By the way,” Milano interjected, “I have two guns in my household for self-defense, just so you know.” The Charmed actress has a history of supporting gun control that would impact law-abiding citizens but would do nothing to prevent lawless behavior of criminals.\n\nFor example, on June 1, 2019, Breitbart News reported that Milano pushed universal background checks in response to the Virginia Beach shooting, where 12 innocents were killed. The problem with Milano’s push was that the Virginia Beach gunman acquired his handguns — not a rifle — and passed a background check while purchasing them. This means universal background check legislation would simply serve to put more hoops between law-abiding citizens and guns for self-defense but would have done nothing to prevent the Virginia Beach shooting.

A year ago, manufacturing businesses had 488,000 openings. The gains to manufacturing came entirely from durable goods jobs, which rose from 315,000 to 322,000. Nondurable openings ticked down from 193,000 to 191,000. The figures for manufacturing suggest that some of the concerns over the manufacturing sectors health may be overstated. As well, they indicate that tariffs are not playing a central role in the troubles of the sector\n\nWhen Trump announced that it would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, critics immediately said that while they might help steel and aluminum producers, they would be a net loser for America because metals-using manufacturing employs far more Americans than metals-producing. The higher price would cause employment in metals-using manufacturing to contract, the critics charged.\n\nThat has not happened. Job openings in durable goods have now expanded for five-months in a row. Hires soared 4.1 percent in July to 5.953 million. That indicates that some of the strain on the economy from the tight labor market may be easing, as employers are finding workers to fill open jobs. The gap between hires and openings narrowed to 1.264 million, the narrowest spread in more than a year.\n\nQuits rose sharply in the month to 3.592 million, a record high, pushing the quits rate up 1 tenth to 2.4 percent. Among private-sector workers, the rate rose to 2.6 percent.

The total number of firearm-related deaths was 39,773. Roughly two-thirds of that figure, 23,854, were firearm-related suicides, with the remaining 15,919 being a combination of the approximately 500 accidental gun deaths that occur annually coupled with just over 15,000 firearm-related homicides....Now, with the aid of charts released by the CDC, as well as CDC special reports, studies by schools such as Johns Hopkins University, crime statistics from the FBI, and coverage from Breitbart News, consider 10 other causes of death that literally eclipse the number of daily deaths involving a rifle: \n1. Daily Heart Disease Deaths: 1,773\n2. Daily Cancer Deaths: 1,641\n3. Daily Medical Malpractice Deaths: 685\n4. Daily Accident Deaths: 465 \n5. Daily Lower Respiratory Disease Deaths: 439\n6. Daily Stroke Deaths: 401\n7. Daily Alzheimer Deaths: 332\n8. Daily Diabetes Deaths: 229\n9. Daily Drug Deaths: 192\n10. Flu: 152\nFor those who argue that rifle deaths ought to be compared to deaths by other voluntary activities, rather than disease, consider the following six examples:\n\n1. Daily Drunk Driving Deaths: 29\n2. Daily Deaths from Crossing the Street: 16\n3. Daily Distracted Driving Deaths: 9\n4. Daily Deaths by Knives and Other Sharp Instruments: 4\n5.

The sergeant who was shot is “recovering well,” Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke told the local media, from the gunshot wound he sustained above one of his knees.

After fleeing the property in a truck, Herrera dumped his truck and stole a white pickup truck before fleeing once again, leading police on a high-speed chase that lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. During this chase, the illegal alien fired gunshot rounds at California Highway Patrol officers.\n\nWarnke told local media that Herrera had previously been in law enforcement custody but that they were unable to turn him over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency because of California’s sanctuary state law, which shields criminal illegal aliens from deportation. “We had him in our custody in January of this year, and because of the folks in Sacramento limiting our ability to cooperate with ICE, we could not turn him over,” Warnke said. “This kind of rings of what happened to Ronil Singh in Newman.” “Not only has this guy been a proven danger prior to this incident, the attempted murder of one of my sergeants... he should have been not in this country.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5c223007c424b55d6ec4ae8bfa854c0c/5E57027B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/68761813_517200372374693_4511563180593097603_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Fia7jnk4R/", "caption": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was rebuffed after trying to grab the hands of a younger woman in Iowa earlier this week, while talking to her about his candidacy.\n\nBiden, who was publicly accused by several women of unwanted touching earlier this year, had the awkward encounter on Monday while courting voters at a Labor Day picnic put on by organized labor in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.\n\nVideo of the incident, which was published by the Washington Examiner on Friday, shows Biden talking to the 41-year-old special needs educator about his plans for strengthening collective bargaining rights for  teachers in states like Iowa.

Following the revelations, several more women came forward to accuse Biden of unwanted touching.\n\nDespite issuing a public apology and promising to be more “mindful” about respecting the personal space of others, Biden has repeatedly made light of the accusations on the campaign trail.\n\nFlores has said those jokes prove the 76-year-old Biden has “not reflected” on how his behavior made women feel.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ada65196128e7ecc1073bab320e18fd9/5E507833/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.36.1311.1311a/s640x640/70004713_965024840507607_8098459607789780746_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2E1kdgHuto/", "caption": "🇺🇸🎉🇺🇸🎉🇺🇸SO. MUCH. WINNING!!!!🎉🇺🇸🎉🇺🇸🎉🇺🇸 The unemployment rate for African-Americans fell to the lowest level ever recorded in August, dropping from 6 percent to 5.5 percent.\n\nOne result: the persistent gap between white and black unemployment also narrowed to its smallest on record. The unemployment ratio has averaged around 2 to 1 or so for decades, meaning the black unemployment rate is typically twice the whtie unemployment rate.  In good times, the unemployment rate of whites and blacks falls but the gap remains. And in bad times, the unemployment rate for whites and black rises, but black unemployment typically remains around twice that of white employment. A year ago, the black unemployment rate stood at 6.6 percent while the white unemployment rate was 3.4 percent, meaning black unemployment was 185 percent of white unemployment. In August, the gap narrowed so that black unemployment was under 162 percent of white unemployment. That is the smallest gap ever in records going back to January 1972.\n\nThis is particularly remarkable because it comes at a time of remarkably low unemployment. Prior to the Trump era, the last time the gap fell below 170 percent was in August of 2009, when the black unemployment rate was 14.8 percent and the white unemployment rate was 8.9 percent. Back then the gap declined because white unemployment was increasing at a faster clip than the already sky-high black unemployment.\n\nIn other words, the decline in employment inequality now is undeniably the best on record because it comes in the context of falling unemployment.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/07677f11c49fad784f5f600254b62b9f/5E40A025/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/69230295_133338237929366_7591065683918379348_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B2EuHAEHnx-/", "caption": "🔶BY: Allum Bokhari🔶 Banning plastic straws. Carbon taxes. Stopping people from eating meat. Stopping people from having babies.\n\nAm I just seeing things? Or are all the “climate crisis solutions” proposed by the Democrats designed to cause maximum pain to ordinary people, and almost none to wealthy elites? Progressives almost seem to take joy in inconveniencing the masses for no reason. Take the plastic straw ban, for example. Even National Geographic — hardly an anti-environmentalist publication — admits that plastic straws comprise just 0.025 percent of the plastic in the oceans. Contrast the minimal impact of plastic straws with the extraordinary impact of China, and, by extension, global free trade. China, alone, produces around a third of the ocean’s plastic waste. China’s CO2 emissions are greater than the U.S. and Europe combined, and keep going up.\n\nIf Democrats really believe that climate change is an existential threat to humanity, why are they proposing draconian and pointless curbs on the behavior of ordinary Americans? Why aren’t they going after multinationals that continue to do business with the world’s biggest polluter, without demanding any environmental commitments from them (and hey, maybe some human rights commitments too?). You’d think Bernie, at least, would get this. But his big idea is to make everyone have fewer babies. Instead of tackling China, he’s proposing a distinctly Chinese policy. Just because he didn’t say “one-child policy” doesn’t mean the similarity isn’t there... Ask yourself, why is big tech so determined to work with China, despite the political pitfalls? Did Google, which once boasted the hipster motto “don’t be evil,” really think they’d suffer no blowback for developing a censored search engine designed to appease Chinese state censors? Or that working with the Chinese military but not the American one would somehow escape notice?

What should it be? Should it be 60 percent? Should 80 percent of all African-Americans conceived in this country be killed? Would that be enough?

This is the end result of the philosophy of the left today, that Mother Gaia, that the lowly squirrel is more important than human beings. We’re overpopulated, therefore we need to kill more of them.” Gorka highlighted Sanders’s framing of taxpayer funding for abortion as a humanitarian endeavor.

The professor has also reportedly tweeted, “Don’t be the sort of person who people you’ve harmed are happy you’re dying of brain cancer,” in reference to the U.K.-based feminist, Magdalen Berns, who is terminally ill with a rare type of brain tumor.\n\nThe TPUSA activist said that the school responded to the controversy by stating that McKinnon is protected by the First Amendment. “The school’s response is actually kind of funny,” said Theodore, who added that the College of Charleston was recently sued over its “First Amendment practices for not allowing a club on campus.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ccc4a0f66223c599ecc6e5e182a0a286/5E5C25C5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.113.1437.1437a/s640x640/69797471_421809971779689_1218865668143771446_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1_6qkRnnxH/", "caption": "Major cruise liners and The Walt Disney Company are paying it forward by donating millions of dollars to help relief efforts in the Bahamas, which is struggling to rebuild after Hurricane Dorian.\n\nThe storm’s catastrophic winds and flooding killed seven, and relief officials have reported scenes of mass destruction in some areas.\n\nRoyal Caribbean said in a statement it would pledge $1 million towards relief efforts in the area, and its partner ITM in Freeport would donate an additional $100,000. “The Bahamas has been part of our family for nearly 5 decades.

Regardless, the storm is expected to slow down, putting southeastern coastal cities at risk of severe flooding due to storm surge and significant rainfall. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) @rondesantisfl declared a state of emergency for all 67 counties throughout the Sunshine State on Thursday. “All residents, especially those along the east coast, need to be prepared for possible impacts,” DeSantis said. “As it increases strength, this storm has the potential to severely damage homes, businesses and buildings, which is why all Floridians should remain vigilant. Do not wait until it is too late to make a plan,” he added.\n\nWhile the track has shifted, the Florida governor is continuing to urge residents to remain vigilant. “Although the path of #Dorian has shifted, the entire East Coast is still vulnerable to significant impacts. Residents in East Coast counties should continue to monitor local reports and stay vigilant,” he warned Saturday. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp @govkemp (R) also warned Georgians to remain aware and prepared for any possible impacts the storm may bring.

There was never any such policy, and all the Trump administration is doing is moving discretion over individual cases from USCIS to ICE.🔶 The media were abuzz Wednesday and Thursday with claims, such as the one quoted from The Hill, above, that Trump is so hell-bent on deporting people that he is even “deporting kids with cancer,” as Vanity Fair put it (adding that Trump was once again living down to comparisons to Adolf Hitler). Former vice president Joe Biden seized on the news, and added it to his stump speech. He declared, for example, on Thursday night in Greenville, South Carolina: “In just the last few days, we’ve learned his newest target is children. I thought we’d hit the bottom. No! … He decided to take away automatic citizenship from the children of our military serving overseas. … Like every bully in history, he’s trying to make himself seem stronger by picking on the most vulnerable … I thought even he would understand that kids suffering from cancer, cystic fibrosis, and other diseases they can’t get treatment for in their countries were off limits. But like so many other things he’s said, cruelty seems to be the point. … They all have to be unplugged and gone. Ladies and gentlemen — Neuroblastoma! — I can’t imagine, if I had been an immigrant, my son Beau, when he came home from the war, and he ended up having stage 4 glioblastoma … and them telling me, “No, unplug him, send him home.” That’s what it is! That’s what he’s doing! And it’s immoral, and it’s wrong!” Everything about that statement is false.\n\nTrump is not taking away birthright citizenship “from the children of our military serving overseas.” An NBC reporter had to issue a correction: “Experts who have looked at new USCIS [U.S. Citizenship and Immigrant Services] policy say it applies if a service member adopts a child overseas, but children born to service members on deployment would still automatically get citizenship.” (Evidently Joe Biden did not get that particular memo.)", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3867ec5d6d6e7922013ada1dda2974ad/5E4E0733/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.43.1323.1323a/s640x640/67435190_136300687623630_4481951937410254997_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1y1C9xnH27/", "caption": "⬛️⬛️⬛️SHOCK⬛️⬛️⬛️ Canada’s former Prime Minister Kim Campbell is actively “rooting” for Hurricane Dorian to hit President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago, according to a tweet posted on Wednesday. “I’m rooting for a direct hit on Mar a Lago!” Campbell, the country’s first female prime minister, exclaimed on Twitter.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/93a32df67c0149b0afdb74a969c9e21e/5E5AE00E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69827425_121282282565098_3292121491250951041_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1yvwDTH484/", "caption": "🔷Making Transgender History in Women’s Athletics🔷 “You shouldn’t have to give up what you love, to be who you want to be,” Juniper Eastwood said.

Even his supporters know who he is. We got to let him know who we are. We choose unity over division,” the former vice president said towards the end of his stump speech. “We choose science over fiction. We choose truth over facts.” As Breitbart News reported, the comment was likely the result of Biden flubbing an applause line he frequently uses on the trail: “we have to choose hope over fear, unity over division and, maybe most importantly, truth over lies.” The 76-year-old candidate’s gaffes only increased from there, culminating in Biden making a racially insensitive remark about “poor kids” and claiming he was in office during the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida — which took place one year after he left he White House.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/09beb8744d4538e2cc3b9adbe6a141d6/5E48F5A7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.35.1308.1308a/s640x640/67807027_185663715788064_2857758303393896517_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1r_LyUn4Ec/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0d32a2cb19b493140b1b8f680e33794d/5DC1A26B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/67583126_472926596770596_5289899254709616186_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1rk5SPHswp/", "caption": "The wife of a Democrat consultant alleges her husband engaged in an extramarital affair with freshman Rep.

Dr. Mynett also alleges her spouse dropped a “shocking declaration of love” for the far-left lawmaker and dumped her soon after, state filings submitted to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on Tuesday. “The parties physically separated on or about April 7, 2019, when Defendant told Plaintiff that he was romantically involved with and in love with another woman, Ilhan Omar,” the documents read.\n\nDespite her husband’s alleged actions, Dr. Mynett says she told him she was “willing to fight for the marriage,” but she claims the political consultant told her their relationship was done. The couple married in 2012 and have a 13-year-old son together.\n\nOmar has dished out roughly $230,000 in campaign funds in consulting fees and travel expenses to Mynett’s E Street Group since 2018.\n\nThe development comes after a Daily Mail report stating Omar is no longer living with her husband, Ahmed Hirsi, who she fired as a policy advisor. Before Hirsi, the Minnesota Democrat was married to Ahmed Nur Said Elmi. Omar has faced scrutiny stemming from a joint tax return she filed with Hirsi in 2014 and 2015 — before they were actually married and while Omar was legally wed to another man.\n\nOmar has claimed that she married Hirsi, who then went by Ahmed Aden, in an Islamic ceremony in 2002, though never married legally. The pair split up 2008 and she married Elmi, legally, the next year. Even though the lawmaker split from Elmi in 2011, she remained married to him while she filed tax returns with Hirsi. Records show she divorced Elmi before marrying Hirsi. Elmi has faced allegations that he is Omar’s brother, a claim that Omar has denied.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bff81e3410f626f8e418622b1193b326/5E57379E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.102.1421.1421a/s640x640/69423618_160283778455725_2560441873112366079_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1rgYzInEAc/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c7b8f89600f77fe2deed3383015ff331/5DC18459/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/69523842_502250837257788_2805724631954592518_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1q9wDTnWyi/", "caption": "On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “AC360,” CNN host Van Jones reacted to Monmouth University’s poll showing a 3-way tie between 2020 Democratic presidential candidates former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) by stating that he “would be very concerned” if he was in Biden’s camp about the size of the progressive block and praising Warren’s performance on the campaign trail.\n\nJones said, “Listen, this is not a good poll for Biden, and I do think that it speaks — you have to look at all the other polls, all that sort of stuff.

This kind of cuts against the idea that the only thing that matters is electability. People may be recalculating what makes someone electable. I think the traditional wisdom has been you’re electable if you’re more appealing to moderates, if you can kind of get the independents. That narrative was really carrying Biden along. I think now you’re starting to see people make the case it’s going to be somebody who can — you’re electable if you can electrify. … If I were in the Biden camp, I would be very concerned about the fact that, right now, he’s holding his own in the top three against a whole bunch of other people, but look at that progressive block.” He added that Warren is “the most impressive person on the scene right now.

I inspire people.” “My whole mission in life is to encourage people to stand up for what they believe in,” Williams said. “And the pageant was kind of a way for me to showcase that.” “I think that was the biggest issue for me,” Williams said. “There were other contestants posting things that were more on the liberal viewpoint, yet when I did it — and of course it was a conservative viewpoint — that’s when the problem actually arose.” When asked about her future pageant ambitions, Williams said she is moving on. “I don’t think I’m going to probably compete in any more pageants,” Williams told Breitbart News Tonight. “I think that part of my life is over.” But she said she will continue her “fight against censorship of the conservative viewpoint.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/deba4df5bf2e6afb65641cc5e2add676/5E427634/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/67404669_728235064273244_7515154186381443939_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1gnSV9n37i/", "caption": "Parkland father Andrew Pollack says Americans need to be armed for self-defense, because when seconds count “first responders are minutes away.” Pollack’s daughter, Meadow, was killed in the February 14, 2018, attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Critics hate the idea and mock it as absurd and wasteful. But the President makes the deal, and the purchase proves to be one of the most brilliant geopolitical deals in history—a huge boon to American strength and prosperity.\n\nAm I describing the 45th President’s effort to buy Greenland from Denmark? Nope, I’m describing the 17th President’s successful effort to buy Alaska from Russia in 1867. It was one of the best bargains America ever struck. If President Trump can pull off another deal like that, I say God bless him! Greenland’s vast arctic expanse—which, at over 800,000 square miles, is more than a quarter the size of the U.S. Lower 48—is surely another Alaska in terms of untapped wealth. The media would do well to chill with mocking President Trump and instead learn some U.S. history. Our country’s desire to purchase Greenland predates the purchase of Alaska.... China understands that Greenland is strategically vital. Up there at the top of the world, it has a commanding position on the Arctic Ocean, not far from Russia.  I, and others, predict the Arctic Ocean will become a key international seaway, with an incalculable advantage going to Greenland.\n\nIt’s precisely because of Greenland’s strategic location that we put our northernmost military base there. The Thule Air Force base is crucial to our nation’s missile defense system. Again, is it any wonder why China is so eager to get a foothold in Greenland? As William Seward knew when he purchased Alaska from the Russians, controlling a strategic location allows the United States to establish a forward base and prevent our enemies from doing the same.\n\nSo, as a matter of national security as well as economic prosperity, it makes sense for the United States to have a strong footprint in Greenland.\n\nSo, go for it, Mr. President.

Pro-migration advocates strongly oppose the regulation, even though it is also likely to reduce the death of children who are brought up to the border by their job-seeking parents. The opponents are expected to ask judges to block the regulation before it can go into effect.

Without the revenue from a job in the United States, migrants know they will likely lose the farms and houses which they typically mortgage to pay the smuggling coyotes upfront.

The news tab is reportedly an effort by Facebook to restore some credibility to the site’s news feed which it believes has become inundated with fake news and clickbait. Facebook plans to personalize the News Tab meaning it will require a vast amount of content on a wide range of topics for users. The new venture is reportedly part of a personal project by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to improve the company’s relationship with publishers which have previously accused social media of destroying their business models and stealing content. Facebook will reportedly be paying dozens of publishers in order to license content for the News Tab and news from many other sources will be included. The largest partners in the project will be paid millions of dollars a year, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Fears of a recession, however, have been rising, with economists now saying that there is about a 35 percent chance the economy contracts next year. The yield curve briefly inverted last week, often a signal that a recession looms. According to the Washington Post, the talks are in their early stages. A cut to payroll taxes would have to be approved by Congress and could not be done by the White House alone. Americans employed by businesses pay a 6.2 percent “payroll tax” on their earnings, with their employers paying the same amount. Self-employed Americans pay a 12.4 percent tax. That tax is levied to finance Social Security. Americans also pay a Medicare payroll tax of 1.45 for employees and 1.45 for employers.\n\nIn an effort to stimulate the economy, Congress and the Obama administration temporarily cut the employee side of the Social Security payroll tax by two points in 2010. The Social Security trust funds were “made whole” for the lost payroll tax revenue by a transfer of general revenue, meaning the tax cut was financed through larger deficits.\n\nThat temporary cut was originally set to expire at the end of 2011 but was extended through 2013.\n\nA study by economists Christina Romer and David Romer found that tax cuts are effective at providing anti-recessionary economic stimulus. Payroll tax cuts work by immediately giving Americans a boost in take-home pay–at least some of which tends to be spent into the economy.\n\nVery low-interest rates on government bonds, particularly long-term Treasuries, may make a payroll tax cut even more attractive.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e8086ed47acd3398d7cf16f5843f9af7/5E63CA9D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.29.1298.1298a/s640x640/69173108_2419129621705125_6159692849123059378_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1XXYyFHwEa/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b519a36eeaa47800de0bd99c8b6a0dc3/5DC166C2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67802630_404635583782573_1905925178471509183_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B1XEw0_H54y/", "caption": "🔶Too little, too late?🔷 Sen.

The parents worked to instill moral and ethical values in their children, according to Arguster Davis, 67, the youngest brother of the pack.\n\nAs soon as the boys graduated high school, it was a natural path for them to enter military service.

Thomas Davis, survived the surprise ambush at Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe first brother, Ben Davis Jr., enlisted in the Navy in 1944 in the middle of World War II. Arguster enlisted in the Air Force for four years and then served in the Air Force Reserve until 1998. “Being in the military, it was a fine thing,” said one brother Lebronze Davis, 70, who fought in the Vietnam War as an Army soldier and has survived cancer and heart surgery. “We all think we’ve done an outstanding job.” Seven of the 11 brothers recently reunited in Tunica, Mississippi, to do some gambling and hit the buffet tables to celebrate three July birthdays. “We just like to get together and talk trash and just have a good time,” said Octavious, 80, who served in the Army. “All of us are close.” There were four out of the 11 veterans who could not make the get-together. Washington Davis — who served six years in the Army — passed away. The others, Ben Davis; Alphonza Davis, a 29-year-veteran of the Army; and Calvin Davis, who did a four-year stint in the Navy, could not attend the reunion. These brothers’ service to the nation has not gone unnoticed. In 2017, the National Infantry Museum Foundation honored the 11 men and their uncle for their service to this country by etching their names into four paving stones at the museum in Columbus, Georgia. “What these brothers did out of love for both family and country is nothing short of remarkable.\"", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c0f41f8380316cd76944e1ef7384b867/5E430FFE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.32.1304.1304a/s640x640/67635541_403292900301203_21624520358794764_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0_rPoXna9B/", "caption": "😂 💰 Well that sure didn't work out the way Leftists hoped it would! 😂 💰 Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel announced Friday that President Donald Trump raised $12 million at two separate fundraisers in the Hamptons. “Thanks to the unhinged mob on the left, @realDonaldTrump raised $12M today, $2M more than originally expected,” McDaniel wrote in a tweet. “The support for our President is unprecedented and growing,” McDaniel added.

In Texas, the death penalty is only sought in cases where prosecutors believe the suspect committed particularly atrocious crimes against victims.

Chemirmir was originally charged with the murder of 81-year-old Lu Thi Harris in March 2018. Eventually, the illegal alien was charged with murdering another 11 elderly women between the ages of 76 and 94 years old while he was working at a nursing home.\n\nBreitbart News exclusively reported that Chemirmir first arrived in the U.S. on a B-2 visa — commonly known as a tourist visa — in July 2003.

Gillette generated heated social media pushback earlier this year after it debuted a series of commercials that criticized masculinity and featured a transgender adolescent learning to shave. While it has traditionally marketed its razors to men — “the best a man can get” — Gillette has been trying to reach new demographics in a bid to revive a flagging business that has seen a decline in demand for razors and blades.\n\nOne such effort was a Gillette commercial spotlighting masculinity and the #MeToo movement. The spot depicted scenes of bullying, sexual harassment, and mansplaining. “Is this the best a man can get?” the commercial asked. Industry experts interpreted the commercial, which debuted in January, as a bid by Gillette to attract more female consumers. Gillette debuted another commercial in May showing a transgender male adolescent learning how to shave. Consumer reaction to the commercials was wildly polarized, with the hashtag #boycottGillette trending on Twitter.\n\nMedia figures including Piers Morgan, Gov.

The former vice president than proceeded to argue that when Americans were united there was nothing they could not overcome, before delivering another gaffe. “If you agree with me,” he said. “Go to Joe 3-0-3-3-0, thank you very much.” Biden likely meant to describe a way in which supporters could reach out and contact his campaign.

In contrast, Biden did not specify whether the purported destination was a website or a phone number.

Political observers attribute the president winning the state to his support from white working-class voters, a group for normally votes Democrats. Booker made similar comments about Russia’s so-called suppression of African-Americans before the Urban League Convention in Indianapolis, Indiana, last Friday, saying instead of President Trump addressing the Kremlin’s actions, the president has treated Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “pal.” Of Russian interference, it was actually far-left Hollywood director Michael Moore who participated in a November 2016 rally against then-President-elect Donald Trump that was allegedly organized by Russia in an attempt to sow division in the United States.\n\nThe Fahrenheit 9/11 moviemaker joined protesters outside Trump Tower in New York City to participate in the “Trump is NOT my president” rally, which then former special counsel Robert Mueller revealed was one of several events designed to stir unrest in America in the country.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4a61fbb72220be1597d7d90f4ccabb3b/5E564B0D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.116.1440.1440a/s640x640/65767444_105875867311009_7943470466280746182_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0msa6GHdRa/", "caption": "#demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c826b36130f4ca56dd48ae5724f29c67/5E5150FC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66429490_160041058471289_6550194727299153579_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0mp3Icn4xK/", "caption": "🤡🤦‍♀️SO LAME🤦‍♀️🤡 #demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/511e548342cb17f7da4a6d803fae4047/5E42C272/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67642471_203113220681637_2544117258815528296_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0mmpQpHw_G/", "caption": "#demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e70bc15258e5cdce90f698825d13b6ac/5E3E5D2C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67187210_2667047513581906_1950356356004224494_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0mlB5THfHY/", "caption": "🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 President Trump ordered the Navy to rescind achievement medals awarded to prosecutors involved in the case against Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was found not guilty of war crimes in a trial earlier this month. “The Prosecutors who lost the case against SEAL Eddie Gallagher (who I released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly), were ridiculously given a Navy Achievement Medal,” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “Not only did they lose the case, they had difficulty with respect to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion,” he added. “I have directed the Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer & Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards.” “I am very happy for Eddie Gallagher and his family!” he concluded.

Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) claimed she saw “cages of babies” at the United States-Mexico border during CNN’s 2020 Democrat presidential primary debate on Tuesday.\n\nWhile advocating for decriminalizing illegal immigration into the U.S., Warren claimed she had witnessed with her own eyes “cages of babies” held in detention at the southern border. “What we can’t do is not live our values,” Warren said. “I’ve been down to the border, I have seen the mothers, I have seen the cages of babies. We must be a country that every day lives our values. And that means we cannot make it a crime when somebody comes here.” For months now, illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border has increased significantly, leaving federal immigration officials with increasingly less space to detain and hold migrants. Last year, the Trump administration enforced its zero-tolerance policy to stop the flow of illegal adult border crossers from arriving at the country with minor children. The separation of adult border crossers from the children they arrive with, though, has occurred since before 2001, court records have shown, and the Obama administration used the same detention centers that are currently being used.\n\nTo date, Warren has yet to provide photos that show babies being held in cages together.\n\nDetaining child border crossers was a policy during the Obama administration, where Breitbart Texas exclusively reported on the conditions in which unaccompanied minors were being packed into crowded cells and holding facilities.\n\nAs Breitbart News has noted, Health and Human Services (HHS) centers where unaccompanied minors are often sent feature comfortable living conditions.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dc97bfb1deb5bbeb7d2ca5460f28db70/5E58C687/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/65641578_720786075017058_7641530562077878363_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0j_NC1HNJm/", "caption": "#DemDebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/71dc181474f5f0fb1ff413d71993767c/5E42F75E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/65707958_164479944686312_1536304193560128471_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0j-ODmHGqH/", "caption": "🔴How quickly Democrats forget.🔴 #DemDebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e20ff7be56c53e9da0c9db3ea2767b50/5E63580D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/65693677_409724586333368_5474555901080384842_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0j8SukHqeE/", "caption": "🤣 ☕️ 🤣 ☕️ #DemDebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/27648232512993d61aa3c1a64d3e7a05/5E43DE11/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66670294_434707487119548_4151016366930707172_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0j23Gvnoxo/", "caption": "***OPEN DISCUSSION THREAD*** #DemDebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/da3776e8f8a54004e9c6bf3f87b35450/5E44326A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66452641_2592525537425387_3094783456747129100_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0jv514H_Rt/", "caption": "🤣🤣Let the good times roll!! 😂😂 #DemDebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3b6ce42c01a870956a6a5fee9a77a7b2/5E4D4B36/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66373191_184566249227422_6486463179626693478_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0jkyeMnUbM/", "caption": "💥💥💥CNN executives have rigged the July 30 Democratic debate to protect “their party” from a damaging repeat of the first debates, GOP Sen.

Elijah Cummings (D-MD), whose district encompasses Baltimore. Over the weekend, the president blasted the 13-term congressman for the Maryland city’s worsening conditions, calling it a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” and a “very dangerous & filthy place.” He also said conditions in the city are “far worse” and than those at the U.S.-Mexico border detention centers. “I mean, if you want to help us, help us. Don’t talk about it, send the resources we need to rebuild America,” Young stated. “He’s talking about he wants to ‘make American great again.’ Put the money in the cities that need it the most and that way you can make America great again.” According to the official copy of the city’s Fiscal Year 2019 budget, Baltimore is already spending “$66.3 million in federal grants,” and its “federal fund operating appropriation is budgeted at $165.9 million.” “In Fiscal 2019… the Federal government is providing a combined $30 million for the renovation of City streets, highways, and traffic engineering projects,” the document reads on page 185.

It also implemented a fingerprinting/registration process for new handgun buyers.\n\nThe number of homicides in Baltimore was 211 for the year 2014, but has been over 300 every year since. @awr_hawkins", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/cbae1576e5de6d32ad70b4c81c79229b/5E42E759/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.38.1315.1315a/s640x640/66714816_2685100824886536_5753316249130115966_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0d3XsentBN/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a1a6239b8362a8f5b06fa18ee5b8ad06/5E5DB35A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67492607_516925545515683_4902645087753786832_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0dmW56HGc1/", "caption": "🔷🔷 Are Bernie Sanders’ comments about Baltimore racist?🔶🔶", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dc815a08099d8735e02559fbc6ddd148/5E3ED3AE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/67717280_119667489324466_1233220836849473471_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0djcX6nLdM/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5dc03fdaf939feedfff2eff897486415/5E4E1340/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66494799_371343803577906_6278606920606864375_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0cLZWTnlG5/", "caption": "President Donald Trump @realdonaldtrump said on Saturday that he is considering labeling the far-left activist group Antifa a terrorist organization. “Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others),” Trump wrote in a tweet.

CNN’s statement accepting the resignation of the editor makes clear the editor had worked at CNN for some time, and had made the antisemitic statements back in 2011.\n\nThe tweets from Mohammed Elshamy, a photo editor for CNN, first surfaced earlier on Thursday. They were until then still public on Elshamy’s Twitter account. At first, CNN ignored Elshamy’s history of antisemitism. Then Elshamy hid his Twitter account from the public. It remains to be seen if CNN will be honest with its audience about this matter and any internal investigations into it. CNN has a history of covering up resignations of people involved in scandals in its organization. In 2017, three senior CNN officials resigned amid a fake news story on the Russia probe–and CNN has still not answered a series of questions about the matter and has not published, as is the ethical standard for organizations purporting to publish news content, its findings of the internal investigation into the publication of that fake news.\n\nCNN spokespersons have not replied to requests for comment when asked who hired Elshamy, how these comments were not found during his hiring process when they were publicly available at that time, whether anyone else will be held accountable for the severe missteps in vetting of CNN staff, and whether CNN will be conducting a review of other staff for antisemitic comments or a review of CNN’s published content in which Elshamy had a role. The CNN staff has also not answered whether such reviews, if done, will be in the interest of journalistic integrity made public for CNN’s audience to see.\n\nCNN is moderating the Democrat presidential primary debates next week in Detroit, Michigan, on Tuesday and Wednesday evening.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/10cbc0de8be000bf1d159d7cdb96695e/5E460B44/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.119.1440.1440a/s640x640/66484753_143505730184472_8778891275428431811_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0XYLyDHqHB/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/23f18ecc8034b5f9ee287b39eb56abf4/5DC189A6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.280.720.720a/s640x640/66106305_485789912174983_5860738191495701819_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B0XFhNFnUXp/", "caption": "🙏❤️🙏❤️ A billionaire in Singapore is making headlines after a video posted last year recently surfaced in which he said his relationship with Jesus Christ is most important in his life.

Ng oversees the company’s Singapore interests while Robert and his son oversee the organization’s Hong Kong arm. “I was always in search for a better life, a better purpose, a better me, a better everything,” Ng told young entrepreneur Yao, 20, who views Ng as a mentor. “I was just looking at all the wrong things, but when I realized there is no better me or better things without Jesus. Then it all snapped into place.” The billionaire said having faith “sure beats a lot of money and material things that you may have.” “Maybe we have to look deeper,” he said. “I treasure (my faith) more than anything so I just wish for everyone to have that peace and joy.” Yao posted that he himself had been arrested and expelled from school at age 15.

Both analysts questioned whether Mueller’s appearance was part of a “strategy.” On NBC News, Justice Correspondent Pete Williams noted the stark change in Mueller’s abilities. “This is not the same Robert Mueller,” he said, noting that the former FBI director’s appearance was starkly different from when he testified in Congress six years ago.

Doug Collins (R-GA) caught former Special Counsel Robert Mueller in a contradiction in his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday morning, noting that Mueller was saying something different now than he said in his report.\n\nDemocrats had hauled Mueller before the committee after the report found that there had been no collusion between any American and the Russian government in attempting to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, and failed to arrive at a conclusion about obstruction of justice. (Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined that there was insufficient basis for an obstruction of justice prosecution.) Dissatisfied with the outcome of the investigation, and with President Donald Trump’s repeated claims of exoneration, Democrats were eager to have Mueller testify directly. He agreed to do so but stated that he would not testify to anything that was different from his report. In his opening statement, Mueller stated: “We did not address collusion, which is not a legal term. rather, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy, and it was not.” That statement suggested that the report had not, in fact, concluded that Trump had colluded with Russia — contrary to what the president has said, and with common public understanding of the report.\n\nCollins began by asking Mueller whether “collusion” and “conspiracy” were synonymous.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) was found Tuesday to have told a political opponent in the past that she needed to be deported — using a rhetorical tactic that Democrats have said is “un-American” and “racist.” Last Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted that Omar and three other far-left Democratic congresswomen in the so-called “Squad” should “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came” and then “come back and show us how it is done.” He did not call for them to be deported, and later clarified that he meant simply that if they did not like the U.S., they should leave. Some members of a large rally crowd in North Carolina chanted “Send her back,” in reference to Omar, during Trump’s speech there last Wednesday. The president disavowed it the next day.\n\nBut Omar has, in fact, called for an opponent to be deported. Her tweet, from 2012, was unearthed as a similar tweet from Rep.

The proposal offers a guaranteed income – up to $6,000 per year – to families and individuals under certain financial thresholds via a “refundable tax credit that can be paid monthly.” The Michigan lawmaker’s BOOST Act serves as her response to what she calls the “GOP Tax Scam,” despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans will pay less in taxes in 2018, thanks to the tax cuts. “Recently, I introduced the Boost Act. This legislation completely repeals the GOP Tax Scam that is only helping wealthy individuals – the rich, the corporations,” she told the crowd. “And do you know what I did with that money?

In April, female unemployment reached 3.4 percent, the lowest it has been since October 1953. The unemployment rate for women is currently 3.6 percent, slightly below the national average, and women have filled nearly 3.1 million of the new jobs created since the President took office. That’s not just an abstract number. It represents single mothers who no longer have to worry about how to provide for their children, college graduates who have been able to get their careers started on a strong footing, and young women who now have the freedom to independently pursue their personal and professional ambitions.\n\nPresident Trump’s rejuvenating economic policies are helping women in other ways, too.\n\nThe 2017 middle-class tax cuts, for instance, strengthened American families by allowing working parents to keep more of their hard-earned money every year. In fact, married couples with two children saved an average of $2,917 on their federal income taxes in 2018.\n\nNotably, the Trump tax cuts also doubled the child tax credit, reducing the tax burden on working families so that they have more resources to devote to their children... American women have a clear choice in the next presidential election: we can either support a political party that promises to improve our lives with policies that would actually accomplish just the opposite, or we can vote for a President whose policies are already enabling us to prosper like never before.\n\nThe Democrats like to claim that they are the party of women — in reality, though, no politician has done more for women than Donald J.

The focus group, conducted by Engagious/FPG, revealed that the majority of the 12 swing voters said Trump is “professionally and responsibly” handling the current crisis of mass illegal immigration at the southern border. Likewise, the swing voters slammed 2020 Democrats’ latest plan that would provide free health care to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S., paid for by American taxpayers. As Breitbart News has reported, the plan would cost taxpayers at least $660 billion every ten years. “Why would you want to give it to another person from a different country for free?” one swing voter asked, according to Axios‘s Alexi McCammond, who sat in on the focus group. “Give them free benefits, this that and the other thing,” another said. “That is ridiculous. They’ll come from anywhere and get a house and a car, too.” “We need to focus on Americans and not the immigrants,” a swing voter said.\n\nOne swing voter hit back against the U.S. policy of providing birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal aliens, saying, “We shouldn’t give away our birthright like candy.

Los Angeles challenged that decision in federal court, arguing that the decision violates federal law and limits on Congress’s authority under the Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nA 1994 federal law authorizes the Department of Justice (DOJ) “to provide a range of federal assistance to state and local law enforcement,” Judge Sandra Ikuta wrote on Friday, describing DOJ’s administering “a competitive grant program that allocates a limited pool of funds.” “In 2017, Los Angeles applied for a grant, but failed to score highly enough to earn one,” Ikuta continued for the three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\nCongress’s law “linked to the goal of enhancing the crime prevention function of state and local law enforcement through working with the community,” the San Francisco-based court continued.  Federal law 34 U.S.C. § 10388 authorizes DOJ to “promulgate regulations and guidelines to carry out” the grant program to achieve the program’s goals. “The Application Guidelines set out a series of questions and instructions that allow an applicant to explain why it is seeking a grant and why it is best qualified to receive one,” wrote Ikuta. “Among other things, an applicant must explain its need for federal assistance, provide information about its fiscal health, agree to comply with various provisions of federal law, and provide additional information and assurances of various kinds.” “DOJ evaluates, scores, and ranks the submitted applications, then awards grant funds to the highest scoring applicants,” the opinion noted. “The scoring process is designed to allocate federal assistance to programs, focuses, or conduct that DOJ deems to best further statutory purposes and federal goals.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c7470e6df330ce1f914bff0fcf8f87f9/5E4DBFD0/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.47.1330.1330a/s640x640/66231916_342861843318681_2091841360165457157_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz9Lha4nsKb/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/754346a1a4bfe07b760909549aa0a4f9/5DC17429/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66149998_496568117820999_8013751873940503443_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz88BU1ni4K/", "caption": "President Donald Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) raised $108 million in the second quarter and have $123 million in cash on hand, according to a joint statement released Monday. “President Trump’s record of success for America is drawing unprecedented support from across the nation,” Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. “As the Democrats continue their race to the left, Americans are responding to the President’s pledge to Keep America Great.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f859d53828eabd54769fa51d86b02a8b/5E631064/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.68.1366.1366a/s640x640/66246430_393696664606265_1001296341918942780_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz8x_S9H6NA/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ced2289b43e7e05498103f6dff09bdd7/5E606212/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66401602_149939849409607_4263682174375327070_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz8kBACHouy/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/926a65d55f0ffc0b5a3cf33cfdf90649/5E5CA400/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66651151_155162935654929_3457921246399657825_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz8ct3fnex9/", "caption": "🔴Thank you, @prageru ! 🔴 “Alex Marlow @marlownews and his colleagues at Breitbart are among the most impressive people I know,” said Dennis Prager on Friday’s edition of his eponymous radio show, offering his praise of this news media outlet following a live conversation with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow. “[Alex Marlow] called in because he listens to the show. I’m very touched,” said Prager of Marlow’s listenership to his program. “Does having children make you happy?” asked Prager of his audience. “Do children bring happiness?” On Fridays, the second hour of Prager’s show is entitled the “Happiness Hour,” with last week’s topic being children. Prager regularly declares that happiness is both a choice and moral obligation. He further advises his audience that happy people make the world a better place, while unhappy people make it worse. Along this theme, he recommended compartmentalization of “misery” to protect others from one’s pain: “You really have to compartmentalize, and I think people need to put the unhappy things in a sealed compartment so that the water doesn’t seep out. I always have images in my mind of life, where a ship — and there are compartments — the Titanic sank because the compartments leaked water; they were supposed to be watertight. You will sink if you allow the compartments of misery to leak. They need to be placed in sealed compartments.” Marlow reflected on his experience thus far as a father to an infant son. “I am loving parenthood. I have an 11-month-old, and I think it’s the greatest thing. I’m 33, and it’s my first son, and it is so underrated. … It just so happens the “Happiness Hour” today is on this exact topic, and I’d love to share my thoughts.” “I think society, particularly Judeo-Christian communities, I really think we need to start encouraging younger people to get married and start families earlier on, even if you’re not as far along in that career as you want,” estimated Marlow. “I think this kind of goes hand-in-hand with the broken education system, where we’re all coming out with huge amounts of debts, and it’s slowing the start of families, and that’s a problem to me.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7e3de98046c447c2ef1f71c2ec1193b9/5E4C5F11/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/66092362_198639247790125_277188062553994062_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz8Y8IcnlaA/", "caption": "Billionaire investor, Facebook board member, and Trump supporter Peter Thiel recently called on the FBI and CIA to investigate Google for the “seemingly treasonous” act of aiding the Chinese military.\n\nAxios reports that Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor, Facebook board member, and longtime supporter of President Donald Trump, called on the FBI and CIA to investigate Google for allegedly aiding the Chinese military during his speech at the recent National Conservatism Conference.

The latest analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies Director of Research Steven Camarotta compared and contrasted the cost to American taxpayers of millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S. over a lifetime and the cost of deportation.\n\nBased on research from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the cost of illegal aliens to American taxpayers over a lifetime is about $746.3 billion. Compare this to the cost of a single deportation, which is about $10,854 per illegal alien based on Fiscal Year 2016 totals.\n\nOverall, deporting every illegal alien in the country would amount to a cost savings of about $622 billion over the course of a lifetime. This indicates that deporting illegal aliens is six times less costly than what it costs American taxpayers to currently subsidize the millions of illegal aliens living in the U.S. “There’s a high cost of cheap labor,” Camarotta told Breitbart News.\n\nLast year, President Trump’s administration deported more than 256,000 illegal aliens from the U.S. Assuming that the cost of deportations has been largely unchanged since the Obama administration, this would mean that last year’s deportations, alone, cost about $2.8 billion. Compared to the annual $116 billion that the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) estimates illegal immigration costs taxpayers, deportations conducted last year were more than 40 times less costly.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0a318866817b813bebdd540c5a8a70de/5E612753/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.57.1348.1348a/s640x640/65963030_324938258395394_5115786626043356139_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz1jjK7HITK/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3e4ed352471990446772c4cd4f36e21e/5DC1DCE7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66707424_589963491531443_8905499658215128971_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz1bkHcnjGH/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1ef8592ec0b98481e2c97009e5b19bce/5E420DCF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66412499_889157291459665_8945424056457490970_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz1HkCEnNGO/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f5bd04c373ad83d7f23ba76360b55db2/5DC1ABB5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/66070493_2319983831400952_4533591284589983267_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0xS5an_TT/", "caption": "Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage @nigel_farage has said Sir Kim Darroch is a “fanatical” Europhile and a “globalist” who should have been replaced after the Trump victory.\n\nMr Farage described his first meeting with Sir Kim in 2005 whilst the diplomat was serving as the UK’s ambassador to the European Union, saying within “a few minutes into the conversation, I realised that a civil servant who ought to be politically neutral was a fanatic for building the European Project and the new global order.” “He is a globalist,” Farage told Breitbart News Network’s editor in chief Alex Marlow @marlownews on Breitbart News Daily on Friday.\n\nThe Brexit Party leader added he was furthermore “astonished” that after the election victory of Donald Trump in 2016 that the British government kept Darroch in place as ambassador in Washington, DC. “It was obvious there was no way this man was ever going to have any access to either the President or senior members of the administration because he was diametrically opposed to Brexit, the Trump victory, and known to be a friend to the Clintons,” Mr Farage said.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9e91da25837f00ebcde582af6e06e49c/5E458E33/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.123.1440.1440a/s640x640/66338681_118736602738838_3091629974025654386_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0u35oHvsC/", "caption": "🇺🇸Americans reject socialism.

And people sounded the alarm back then that these agencies are extrajudicial, that they lack effective oversight, and it is baked into the core foundational structure of these agencies.” “Would you get rid of Homeland Security, too?” the host asked. “I think so, I think so,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “I think we need to undo a lot of the egregious mistakes that the Bush Administration did.” The host asked Ocasio-Cortez what she sees as “sane immigration policy.” The freshman democratic socialist blamed Trump for creating the illegal immigration crisis on the border by cutting foreign aid to Central America, called for an end to detention on the border and claimed American citizens want to take in refugees. “This is not a lack-of-resource issue whatsoever,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “There is a lack of desire to allow refugees in.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a3aaa5bb665885ec9f6250cdd0fca0d5/5E4FAA43/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.107.1428.1428a/s640x640/66059310_1654466174697119_1338092248699334303_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzx4vWfnNe5/", "caption": "The U.S. National Women’s National Team (USWNT) used paper from their gender discrimination lawsuit as confetti during their victory parade in New York on Wednesday.

We both do — we might have some differences, but let’s talk about what could be the same.” And just establishing that you do know that they mean well, we just have different ways of getting there, and then being willing to explain things like abortion — saying it’s a woman’s choice, that doesn’t make any sense — because there’s a baby inside of her body that’s a whole separate person with separate DNA — just putting things like that in a different perspective than what they’re normally hearing, because they’re hearing the same couple of things reiterated constantly on social media.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c6cf76710359e00916c9c10cf12d2d19/5E464CA9/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.114.1439.1439a/s640x640/62235749_128005198446186_7860884577470646614_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzvuwksHNm_/", "caption": "🔴Okay all you Freedom-loving, Flag-waving Patriots...NOW look what you’ve done!

The returns show that Biden earned $9.49 million in 2017 through CelticCapri Corp., a shell company named after the couple’s Secret Service code names.\n\nCelticCapri, which was incorporated in Delaware only days after Biden left office, serves as the main vehicle for the former vice president’s public engagements.

In 1953, her husband died, and she became a single mother to two children. Murphy then began working as a seamstress and salesperson to support her family.\n\nState Sen. Brian Benjamin attended the party Friday with a special gift for Murphy. He declared her birthday, July 6, “Alelia Murphy Appreciation Day” for all of Harlem. “She was part of the movement of African Americans to Harlem… Lived in Harlem through it all, through the good and the bad,” Benjamin told reporters.\n\nMurphy is currently the eighth-oldest person in the world, right behind five Japanese women and two French.\n\nThe grandmother says her secret to a long life and excellent health are a good diet and an active lifestyle. “She grew up in the South in the days before processed food, so she ate very healthy,” said Murphy’s nurse, Natalia Mhlambiso. “Keeping active when you are younger, and eating healthy and continuing to do so — it really does help a lot.” Murphy added that trusting in God and being a good person can also help people live a long and happy life. “She’s still here, she’s still strong, and she holds our family together,” her daughter Rose Adams said.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0a1c454b42c40811df89ac1fbc4d2cca/5E446D07/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.38.1315.1315a/s640x640/66155923_493646337844547_2599607334381288682_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzol57sngEz/", "caption": "A majority of Americans want mass deportations of illegal aliens if Congress fails to reach a deal this week that closes loopholes in the country’s asylum system that allow mass flows of foreign nationals to pour through the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe latest Harvard/Harris poll finds that 51 percent of American voters say they support mass deportations of the 11 million to 22 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. should Congress fail to reach a deal that closes loopholes in the asylum system.

That number was revised even lower on Friday, to just 72,000. April’s number was revised down to 216,000 from 224,000. Economists surveyed by Econoday had been looking for a gain of 165,000 for June and for unemployment to remain steady at 3.6 percent. The June number will also be looked to as a barometer for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Last month, the Fed signaled that it was ready to cut rates if the economy continued to show signs of slowing and inflation remained low. The stronger than expected number may create some hesitancy to cut rates. While the economy has continued to grow in the second quarter, it has shown signs of slowing from the rapid 3.1 percent rate of growth in the first three months of the year. Manufacturing has been a weak spot while consumer spending and the labor market have been strong. Economic weakness around the globe may also be weighing on the U.S. economy by reducing demand for U.S. exports. And uncertainty around trade may also be making businesses hesitant to invest and hire.\n\nWith unemployment near 50-year lows, job growth has slowed. Employment growth has averaged 172,000 per month thus far this year, compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018. But wage gains have gone the opposite direction. In June, average hourly wages were 3.1 percent above the year-prior level.\n\nManufacturing jobs showed renewed strength, adding 17,000 jobs after four months of coming in flat.

We’re in the border security business at the border,” Trump said. “And all of a sudden, we’re forced to be in the hospital business.” The president spoke to reporters about the flood of migrants crossing into the United States after signing a bill of emergency funding to improve the conditions of border detainment facilities.\n\nTrump said that most migrants and illegal immigrants were coming to the United States for economic reasons. “They’re coming up because they want a piece of what’s happening in this country. They want the economy. They want the jobs,” he said. “They’re not coming up, for the most part, for other reasons.” Trump thanked Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar for working on the difficult task of caring for migrant minors. “The decks are really stacked against him,” he said. “The cards are not good, and yet the job your people are doing is incredible.” Legally, unaccompanied alien children can only be held for 72 hours by border patrol agents before they are sent to be cared for by Health and Human Services. In May alone, HHS was caring for 13,123 minors.\n\nHHS plans to expand the capacity of child shelters after the new bill sent $3 billion of emergency funding to the agency.\n\nTrump said that the children were used as “pawns” by smugglers and criminals to get individuals into the country more easily. “When you’re with a child, even if the child is not yours — which in itself is ridiculous — then it’s much easier to come across and come into our country because the laws are very bad,” Trump said. “Our immigration laws are very bad.” Border Patrol agents apprehended 332,981 migrants families and 56,278 unaccompanied minors — 389,259 families and children in the first months of 2019.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/aded3e05ebc14bd6655f6f89a328e2c1/5E5FECA9/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.32.1304.1304a/s640x640/66331228_443433623174271_4095665525620587405_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bzc8pconnT0/", "caption": "🔴Remember that time when Leftists protested Obama’s migrant detention centers?

Democrat responses at that time appeared to be more angered that migrants were being detained at all than by the horrible conditions forced upon the migrants by Obama administration policies.  Dozens of photographs published by Breitbart News at that time show migrants packed into small holding cells, often shoulder-to-shoulder. Many of the photos show filthy conditions and some reveal portable toilet units. Other’s show people sleeping on the floor in cold conditions without blankets. Contrast these with the single photo tweeted by U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) this week that shows clean conditions and women with blankets. It is worth noting that Castro’s brother, Julián Castro, is a candidate for the Democratic Party’s nomination for president — seeking to pair off against President Donald Trump in November 2020.

Here is a short list of CNN excusing, complimenting, and encouraging Antifa’s use of violence against CNN’s political enemies on the right:\n\nAntifa fights for a “good cause.”\nAntifa’s fight “is right.”\nAntifa’s punches are more “equal morally” than others.\nAntifa is “on the side of right.”\nAntifa is right because “sometimes you can’t fight by praising them or being nice to them. You gotta fight fire with fire…”\nAntifa is as heroic as the American soldiers who stormed the beaches on D-Day.\nAntifa harassing Ted Cruz and his wife out of a restaurant is “what he signed up for.”\n…any criticism of Antifa is “racist” (even though Antifa is predominantly white).\nThe result of having a cable news outlet dedicated to protecting your organization is an increasingly emboldened Antifa that brutally assaulted Ngo over the weekend. This is not the first time Antifa has assaulted Ngo…\n\nThis is the 15th time Antifa has been caught on video assaulting members of the media. And yet, despite all of this documented violence against members of its own profession, under Zucker’s dangerous leadership, CNN has stood out more than any other outlet as Antifa’s shameless public relations arm.\n\nTo make matters worse, even after openly encouraging and excusing Antifa’s violence, CNN is still serving as the terrorist group’s public relations arm by downplaying this weekend’s violence against Ngo.\n\nIncredibly, during his 47-second “condemnation” of the Antifa assault on Ngo this weekend, Brian Stelter selectively edited the video of the assault to make it look like nothing more than a milkshake/silly string hazing that got a little out of control.\n\nAs you can see below, Stelter deliberately edited out the most brutal portions of the video, the parts where Ngo is sucker punched in the face, swarmed, and kicked.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2e75bef0e6df8366faeedf8e92cf80e5/5E5D3CC6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.107.1428.1428a/s640x640/65825809_370742450111641_2878500267423772538_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzZBBPaHGXw/", "caption": "🔴When will Republicans launch the Biden-China investigation into the $1,500,000,000.00 deal with the Communist Chinese government’s Bank of China?🔴 Former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, did conduct business during his infamous 2013 trip with his father to China, despite previous denials, according to the New Yorker in a story published on Monday.\n\nIn previous stories about his connections with a China investment fund, Hunter Biden’s attorney insisted that Hunter did not conduct business during his trip.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). Center for Immigration Studies Director of Research Steven Camarotta told Breitbart News that only rough estimates are available for what health care for illegal aliens will cost American taxpayers, and though a comprehensive study has yet to be conducted on this specific issue, taxpayers can expect to pay a “significant” amount. “If we offered Medicaid for illegal immigrants, it is possible the costs could be over tens of billions of dollars,” Camarotta said. “However, it would depend on eligibility criteria as well as how many illegal immigrants actually sign up for program once it was offered. So while the actual costs are uncertain, the size would be significant for taxpayers.” A reasonable estimate of health care for each illegal alien, Camarotta said, is about $3,000 — about half the average $6,600 that it currently costs annually for each Medicaid recipient. This assumes that a number of illegal aliens already have health insurance through employers and are afforded free health care today when they arrive to emergency rooms. Based on this estimate, should the full 22 million illegal aliens be living in the U.S. that Yale University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers have estimated there to be, providing health care for the total illegal population could cost American taxpayers about $66 billion a year.\n\nOver a decade, based on the Yale estimate of the illegal population and assuming all sign up for free health care, this would cost American taxpayers about $660 billion.

In the latest edition of The Drill Down With Peter Schweizer @drilldowntv , published at RealClearInvestigations on Wednesday, Schweizer highlights the following figures:\n\n430 former politicians — both congressmen and senators — are now being paid to help shape government policies as lobbyists, consultants, and in other capacities.\n60 percent — nearly two-thirds — of the 44 members who took new jobs after leaving Congress in 2019 now work in lobbying, consulting, or otherwise influencing government activities.\n“Who says bipartisanship is dead in Washington?” jokingly asked Schweizer while highlighting former politicians of both parties who now “work to help special interests navigate the corridors of power in Washington.” Featured examples of the “revolving door” phenomenon used by Schweizer to illustrate his thesis include former Speaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) and Reps. Joe Crowley (D-NY), Lynn Jenkins (R-KS), Billy Tauzin (R-LA), and Anthony Weiner (D-NY). Former Senate Majority Leaders Tom Daschle (D-SD) and Trent Lott (R-MS) are also highlighted in Schweizer’s video report, including former Sen. John Breaux (D-LA). Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) have expressed interest in working together on legislation to prohibit former members of Congress from becoming lobbyists. Schweizer explained the status quo of legal restrictions on former representatives and senators becoming lobbyists: “Currently, the law requires, simply, a ‘cooling off period,’ where a representative cannot register as a lobbyist for one year after leaving office, and if you’re a senator it’s for two years. But after that year is up, things heat up for former members of Congress.

Nuzzi further reported that her source said Biden is rejecting debate advice from staff. “According to Biden’s staff, he isn’t listening to his debate prep and he’s ‘set in his ways,’ the source close to the campaign tells me,” she wrote. Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, denied that the candidate’s camp is in freak out mode, simply tweeting “Nope” in response to Nuzzi. The Democrat Party’s early front-runner was forced to defend his record on race in the face of tough questions from Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), the only African American on stage. That was only after he defended his age after jabs from one of two millennial candidates in the prime-time clash. “I do not believe you are a racist,” Harris said, though she described Biden’s record of working with Republican segregationist senators on non-race issues as “hurtful.” Clearly on defense, the 76-year-old called the Harris attack “a complete mischaracterization of my record.” He declared, “I ran because of civil rights.” The debate marked an abrupt turning point in a Democratic primary in which candidates have largely tiptoed around each other, focusing instead on their shared desire to beat Trump.

It’s about your dignity, it’s about respect… too many people who are in the middle class and the poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.” In order to restore dignity to the middle class, Biden said the country would need to expand health insurance, further educational opportunities, and take care of the environment. For all of that to be possible, Biden explained the next president would need to revaluate the tax cuts that President Donald Trump passed in 2017. “Look Donald Trump has put in a horrible situation, we do have enormous income inequality,” he said. “The one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion dollars in tax loopholes out there, and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump’s tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nSince announcing his campaign, Biden has repeatedly attempted to paint Trump’s tax cuts as only benefiting the super wealthy.

Only interchangable chunks from the stump speeches. You’re going to have to answer that at some point, guess not tonite,” the Real Time host said. Actor Don Cheadle seemed completely put off but the debate halfway through the first hour. “why don’t we just have running color commentary from the booth and a scoreboard and throw instant replay in there too to make it all complete …?” the Avengers: End game star suggested. Actor Michael Ian Black said, “I’ll start watching the debates when we’ve whittled it down to the top 100 candidates.” Actor Billy Eichner was apparently disappointed by all 10 Democrats on the stage Wednesday night, and declared that he’s “voting for Hillary.” As the Democratic White House hopefuls began attacking each other, Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane pleaded for peace, saying “Candidates – please stop yelling. We’re all on the same side.” Beyond boring Hollywood Democrats, the debate was rife with embarrassing moments from a major technical debacle to half the candidates answering questions in Spanish to a format the largely saw the Democrats shouting over each other and the NBC News moderators.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/42856174e61da76965aea769f76cb0b4/5E4D6043/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.43.1323.1323a/s640x640/64481246_430310480883698_7780968815428142347_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzMoBpzHPK3/", "caption": "#demdebate", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f42b2c05a98c51e772609820db6feb36/5E426612/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/64314691_335706243994152_1672828880652639491_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzMlQR3n-AN/", "caption": "😂😂😂 AWKWARD😂😂😂", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2417b4892454d6c4aa81c461ee4cb48c/5E6402B4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.51.1337.1337a/s640x640/62547548_372925340246574_5140894513066389310_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzMixmgnXOb/", "caption": "🔶🔶 NBC just had DISASTROUS and embarrassing technical malfunctions at #DemDebate 🔷🔷", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0a8fa088bfa8755ffbaa8dfd2a215b57/5E5FE6B3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/64294776_145987546462181_5589464389398829021_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzMhDBIHqfD/", "caption": "Former Rep.

Clint Eastwood is coming off his surprise hit The Mule, which starred the 89-year-old, grossed over $100 million domestic, and was itself shot in and around Atlanta last summer.

I can’t ever remember seeing his name on a petition of any kind.\n\nSecondly, everything that happened to his main character, the late Richard Jewell, happened in Georgia during the 1996 Summer Olympics, which were held in Atlanta.\n\nThe boycott was launched in reaction to Georgia’s Living Infants Fairness and Equality (LIFE) Act (HB 481), which outlaws abortion in the state after a heartbeat is detected in the unborn child, which is generally at right around six weeks... In the end, a lot of good people tried to help Jewell, even by making his dreams of working in law enforcement come true, but in 2007, at the age of 44, Jewell died of diabetes, heart and kidney disease, and was never able to live down those 88 days.\n\nI have nothing but faith in the idea that Eastwood is the perfect director for this job, the iconoclast to remind us that fake news has plagued this country for decades and that the establishment American media are nothing less than a dumpster fire of bigotry and lies.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4d94d165f77d3538b254c906c1fa183c/5E62556C/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/64697312_366439947245656_1550934435842555532_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLwS0ZnFCa/", "caption": "GOP leader Kevin McCarthy @repkevinmccarthy is slamming the House Democrats’ border emergency bill for choking agency cooperation against the cartels’ business of smuggling children to foreign parents living illegally in the United States. “Let’s talk about how [Democrats] make this problem even worse,” McCarthy said in a floor speech late Tuesday night, about the $4.5 billion supplemental spending bill. He continued: “After weeks of doing nothing and denying that a crisis exists, they are offering legislation that is misguided and is political. They are once again taking what should be a bipartisan issue and inserting partisan poison pills.” McCarthy specifically targeted the Democrats’ protection for the cartels’ lucrative child-smuggling business, saying: “I’m not sure anybody’s read the bill. I’m not sure even those on the other side know what’s in it. Here’s how it’s worse — [it says the] Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services [HHS] cannot share information about the sponsors of [Unaccompanied Alien] children [UAC]. Think about that for one moment. They’re making sure two departments cannot share information in their own government. This [sharing] is necessary to ensure children are not placed with human traffickers or other predators. Maybe if you had a little time, maybe if you didn’t care about politics, you’d allow a little sharing of information for the children.” The GOP members of the Senate appropriations panel have already accepted a similar pro-cartel gag order which was demanded by Democrats for the Senate’s version of the spending bill.

He also claimed that their efforts now extend beyond conservatives to non-partisan commentators who critique the left as well as the right, like independent journalist Tim Pool.\n\nVia Project Veritas’ interview with the insider: “They described that they were going to have more content filtering, and right after that happened a lot of the content creators started to get demonetized, and their videos started to get deranked.

And so they’re coming in and they’re putting their thumb down, and they’re deciding which content the users are allowed to see.\n\nThey’re playing narrative control.

Here’s what Gennai says in the undercover video: “We all got screwed over in 2016, again it wasn’t just us, it was, the people got screwed over, the news media got screwed over, like, everybody got screwed over so we’re rapidly been like, happened there and how do we prevent it from happening again.

Why? Because, says Gennai, if Google is broken up it can’t prevent another “Trump situation.” “Elizabeth Warren is saying we should break up Google. And like, I love her but she’s very misguided, like that will not make it better it will make it worse, because all these smaller companies who don’t have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation, it’s like a small company cannot do that.” Gennai also declared that no amount of soft pressure from Congress or the White House will make Google change its ways. In other words, talk won’t help — if politicians want to change Google’s behavior, they’ll have to go beyond committee hearings and actually change the law. “We got called in front of Congress multiple times, so we’ve not shown up because we know that they’re just going to attack us. We’re not going to change our, we’re not going to change our mind. There’s no use sitting there being attacked over something we know we’re not going to change.

Democrat’s use of “comprehensive immigration reform” is shorthand for a political deal that would promise better border security for Americans in exchange for an immediate nationwide amnesty that would provide Democrats at least 10 million new voters in a decade. On June 11, for example, Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar touted the 2013 bill to Kevin McAleenan, the acting secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, saying, “Do you think that comprehensive immigration reform that we passed in 2013 in the Senate that was supported by President [Barack] Obama and blocked by the Republican leadership in the House, do you think that would have helped to prevent from happening with all the funding that was there for the border and also having a much more orderly process for legal immigration?” In recent years, Democrats have adopted an increasingly aggressive pro-migration agenda, despite the myriad economic, civic, and political harm to ordinary Americans. Before Trump’s announcement of a delay to the repatriation of illegal migrants, for example, Pelosi issued a statement that characterized the enforcement of judges’ deportation orders on a few hundred recent migrants as terrorism and a “brutal action.” Democrats hope to win this decisive “Comprehensive Immigration Reform” political goal by using business groups to lobby the GOP.

Prior to joining Congress, he was governor of South Carolina from 1959 to 1963, an office he originally sought on the basis of his opposition to the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which struck down segregation in public schools. Hollings kept that stance for the early portion of his term, but eventually changed course and supported integration. It has been noted, though, that full desegregation of South Carolina’s public schools did not occur until after he left the governorship.\n\nIn the Senate, Hollings cut a moderate to liberal profile by championing a national hunger policy and working to reign in the deficit. During his tenure, Hollings’ views on race appeared to grow and develop ,as exhibited by his endorsement of Jesse Jackson in the 1988 presidential race. The issue, however, was still complicated at the time. In 1993, Hollings stirred controversy by saying African diplomats only attended international conferences to “get a good square meal” rather than “eating each other.” When eulogizing Hollings in April, Biden noted his life and views were heavily influenced by the times.\n\nThe fish fry was Biden’s first major public appearance since invoking the late-Sens.

It was a win for everyone. “It was a win for all of our supporters.

Between 2009 and the end of Obama’s second term, more than 19,100 Syrian refugees were admitted to the U.S. — more than 18,500 of which are Sunni Muslims.\n\nDuring the time that Alowemer entered the U.S. from Syria, then-candidate Donald Trump was ringing the alarm about the dangers of mass immigration and refugee resettlement from regions like Syria.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/121bb6ea99db1c115eafecb242d0cc90/5E3E00CC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/64204555_2325851287682285_4110247364593541541_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/By85BAHn3XL/", "caption": "🔷IT BEGINS: Democrats Shred One Another 🔷 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday that Sen.

What is ‘better?’ To stay quiet about it?” At a New York fundraiser Tuesday, Biden pointed to two segregationist senators, James Eastland (D-MS) and Herman Talmadge (D-GA), to argue that Washington functioned more smoothly a generation ago than under today’s “broken” hyperpartisanship. “We didn’t agree on much of anything,” Biden said of the two men, adding that Talmadge was “one of the meanest guys [he] ever knew” and that Eastland called him “son,” though not “boy,” a reference to the racist way many whites addressed black men at the time.\n\nYet even in that Senate, Biden said, “At least there was some civility. We got things done.” The former vice president’s rivals for the 2020 nomination, including the two major black candidates in the race, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Kamala Harris (D-CA), roundly criticized Biden’s comments. Yet, Biden did not back down Wednesday and was particularly defiant in the face of criticism from Booker, who said the former vice president should apologize. In response, Biden said Booker should apologize because the senator “should know better” than to question Biden’s commitment to civil rights. “There’s not a racist bone in my body,” Biden said. “I’ve been involved in civil rights my whole career.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5f2fe399684bd43228fead725788c121/5E4DD928/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.111.1435.1435a/s640x640/64373418_107940343697009_1028080048425675346_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/By8jHhMnXd0/", "caption": "🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Over 5.8 million individuals have discontinued their participation in America’s food stamp program since President Donald Trump’s first full month in office, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data.\n\nThe most recent USDA data shows that 5,829,890 people discontinued their participation in food stamps received through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) since February 2017, Trump’s first full month in office. \nOverall food stamp participation had consistently declined since 2013 back when the Obama administration was in power and enrollment in the program reached its peak in U.S. history.\n\nAfter 2013, SNAP enrollment plummeted once state legislatures passed laws requiring food stamp recipients to work, attend school, volunteer, or participate in job training for a set number of hours per week to receive benefits.\n\nCurrently, there are 36,302,402 people enrolled in the nation’s food stamp program.

In briefs and oral arguments, they asked the court to overturn decades of often unclear and contradictory liberal precedents regarding religious displays on public property.  Justice Alito’s opinion agreed that the court’s earlier rule, known as the Lemon test, provided no clear legal guide for deciding the case. The court held that longstanding memorials such as the Peace Cross were presumptively constitutional.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas, writing in a separate concurring opinion, urged the court to go further and directly repudiate the Lemon test in all contexts. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.\n\nThe 40-foot-tall “Peace Cross” in Bladensburg, Maryland was built to honor the 49 men from Prince George’s County who fell in the Great War. In 1961, a Maryland state agency took possession of the land on which the memorial stands.\nThe American Legions lawyers said the 4th Circuit’s opinion imperiled war memorials all across the country that employ crosses to honor the dead.

The Associated Press notes the objective of the hearing is “to examine, through open and constructive discourse, the legacy of the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, its continuing impact on the community and the path to restorative justice.” Earlier this year, subcommittee member Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) reintroduced H.R. 40 to establish a commission to study reparations. Several 2020 White House contenders, including Sens.

Do you believe in reparations for slavery and, if not, should there be an apology from Congress or from the president in recognition of the theft of labor.\n\nMAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL: I don’t think reparations for something that happened 150 years ago for whom none of us currently living are responsible is a good idea. We’ve tried to deal with our original sin of slavery by fighting a civil war, by passing landmark civil rights legislation. We’ve elected an African-American president. I think we’re always a work in progress in this country, but no one currently alive is responsible for that and I don’t think we should be trying to figure out how to compensate for it.

With The Daily Caller News Foundation, they just released 16 pages of documents revealing senior State Obama officials – Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and Special Coordinator for Libya Jonathan Winer – coordinated with incoming House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer’s (D-MD) national security advisor, Daniel Silverberg, to work on Russia dossier information provided by Christopher Steele. Steele was surreptitiously paid by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee to create the infamous anti-Trump dossier used to justify a series of FISA spy warrants targeting Carter Page. Winer is a former Obama State Department deputy assistant secretary who was implicated in working with Steele and Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal to circulate the anti-Trump dossier. Judicial Watch obtained the documents in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed on April 25, 2018, on behalf of ourselves and The Daily Caller News Foundation against the State Department after it failed to respond to three separate FOIA requests (Judicial Watch v.

Under prior presidents, including Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, migrants in the United States have been allowed to freely apply for green cards via the “Adjustment of Status” process. This “AoS” process is a continuous, unrecognized amnesty because it gives green cards to roughly 550,000 people each year, including many illegals and people who overstay their legal visas. Illegals also use the AoS process to get temporary work permits. In 2018, for example, 257,376 work permits were handed out to a variety of people who applied for AoS.\n\nOne of the few curbs on the AoS amnesty is a requirement that applicants find a sponsor who will repay the taxpayers for any aid and welfare consumed by the AoS applicant. This curb, however, is unused because officials rarely require the sponsors to repay taxpayers when the would-be immigrants do not earn enough wages to stay off welfare. The policy may deter immigrants and citizens from sponsoring unskilled migrants, thus reducing the scale and cost of low-skilled immigration that is imposed on Americans, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “A normal person will think twice and say ‘Whoa, I don’t think I want to take on that [financial sponsorship] responsibility,'” she said. “This is a really good change. … It is about making people qualify [for green cards] based on their likelihood of being self-supporting, and [about] not approving people who will go to the nearest welfare office,” she told Breitbart New Tonight on June 14.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1c5c01b4e60fecea8b790f953c86cc3c/5E3E5249/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.35.1308.1308a/s640x640/64994703_1024824627726960_2509764132140604806_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/By0CPfpHxTC/", "caption": "During an appearance on “Sunday Morning Futures” @mariabartiromo on Fox News Channel, senior White House trade adviser Peter Navarro praised the tariffs used by President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to Navarro, the tariffs achieved more in two days on immigration than Congress was able to accomplish in 20 years. “Polls show that about 80 percent of Americans believe there’s a crisis at the border. If you ask Americans in a poll, what do you think about 100,000 illegal aliens moving every day on a conveyor belt from Guatemala up to San Diego and El Paso, I’d say about 90% of them would object to that.

The order signed by Trump will enforce existing 1996 laws known as the “Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act” and “Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act,” which were signed by then-President Bill Clinton. “Despite it being required under long-standing law, sponsors have never been held accountable for the public benefits taken by immigrants,” an administration official told Breitbart News. “This should be a reminder that signing an affidavit of support as a sponsor is both a promise and responsibility the government takes very seriously and will carry real consequences so that taxpayers don’t bear this burden for them.” The first function of the order mandates that a family member or business sponsor of a legal immigrant looking to permanently resettle in the U.S. is responsible for paying back the welfare costs previously used by that immigrant. Legal immigration controls that would prevent welfare-dependent nationals from permanently resettling in the U.S. — a rule set to be enforced sometime this year — would be a boon for American taxpayers in the form of an annual $57.4 billion tax cut — the amount taxpayers spend every year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country’s mass importation of 1.2 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, the majority of foreign nationals entering the country every year use about 57 percent more food stamps than the average native-born American household.

Sen Cassidy said in a statement Sunday: “Governor Newsom’s plan is a giant magnet for more illegal immigration, and it will hurt California citizens who depend on Medicaid.

A few days after the big groups of African immigrants were apprehended in Texas, federal officials dropped off dozens of them in San Antonio. Officials in the Texas city sent out a plea for French-speaking volunteers for translating work “and most importantly, making our guests feel welcome.” Many were bused to Portland, Maine, about as far as one can get from the Mexican border and still be in the continental United States.

Wade as settled precedent because it is.” “It is the law of the land It has been for over thirty years,” the Democrat senator added. “And the truth is woman reproductive freedom should not be an ideologic or political issue. I think it’s an issue of basic human rights.” “The baby is not her body,” responded King, observing the mother and her unborn baby are two separate lives. “The contributions of chromosomes from both parents of the child in the womb make the baby a distinct person. Where is the lawyer for the baby? How can the dream survive if we murder our children?” Like many black leaders, King observed that Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was a “consultant to the Ku Klux Klan,” and “a terrible racist, a genocidal eugenicist.” “In promoting the sanctity of all human life from the womb to the tomb as ‘racist,’ Sen. Gillibrand is revealing her true colors,” the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. added. “She is supporting abortion, one of the most heinous forms of racism that exists.

Former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew set the process in motion in 2016. Proponents of the bill change hoped that it would be completed by 2020, in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment. However, during an appearance before the House Financial Services Committee in May, Mnuchin noted that a 2020 rollout was improbable– if not impossible– due to daunting technical issues. Mnuchin indicated that the redesigned bill would make an emergence in 2028 with designs coming out two years prior. However, the New York Times spoke to an anonymous employee of the bureau, who supposedly viewed a digital image of the redesigned bill.\nThat source fueled speculation from the New York Times, which pondered if Mnuchin “delayed” the release in order to avoid conflict from Trump, who is a fan of the Andrew Jackson $20 bill.\n“But the Treasury Department, which oversees the engraving bureau, decided that a new $20 bill would not be made public next year. Current and former department officials say Mr. Mnuchin chose the delay to avoid the possibility that Mr. Trump would cancel the plan outright and create even more controversy.” Mnuchin has denied that.\n\nFurther, by citing the anonymous employee, the Times implied that the design is much further along than the current administration is willing to admit.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is denying the Times’ story altogether.

This, too, is a significant increase as the state only has a resident population of about 883,000 residents.

The sex reassignment surgeries covered by Medicaid include 16 types of genital surgery as well as breast augmentation or mastectomy.\n\nAccording to the report, Dr. Rachel Inker, who heads the Transgender Health Clinic at the Community Health Centers of Burlington, welcomed the new rule.\n“Having young people have to wait until they were 21 just didn’t really make any sense,” Inker said.\n\nThe Free Press continued: “The choice to have surgery is a personal one that should be explored in every age group, Inker said, although people who are young enough can be given puberty-blocking treatments to inhibit development of secondary sex characteristics like breasts or facial hair. Older teens may have already developed those characteristics, Inker said, and face going to college or getting a job while their gender identity and gender presentation are mismatched. She cited young transgender men wishing to get top surgery to remove breast tissue as an example of the kind of procedures commonly requested by teenagers between 16 and 18.” In order to receive the Medicaid coverage for sex reassignment surgeries, requirements include a clinical evaluation stating the surgery is a “medical necessity” and a referral from a “qualified mental health professional.” The documentation of the “qualified mental health professional” is to include “diagnosis of persistent gender dysphoria” and documentation of the child’s “participation in a treatment plan in consolidating gender identity.” In addition, the mental health professional must demonstrate the child has been counseled with regard to “treatment options and implications.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/253393324987a8692cca4c21a246b79f/5E4E00BF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/62010075_627037107815347_7048188441656486016_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BytDEEXHb9R/", "caption": "Rapper Vic Mensa released the video for his latest political anthem, “Camp America,” which reimagines ICE detention centers and President Donald Trump’s immigration policy as “summer camps” and sees white children in cages drinking toilet water and ingesting drugs. “We’ll be living it up, not giving a fuck Splitting you up, then we put you in cuffs Then we shipping you off, yeah, you could get lost at Camp America,” Vic Mensa says as images show small children in orange jumpsuits being ordered around by guards in a detention facility.\n“Take your clothes off baby, let me see what you got.

Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) is upset by the prospect of a basic citizenship question on the 2020 census, calling it “radicalized” and arguing that it would make her mother, who has been a citizen for decades, “hesitate.” Wednesday’s House Oversight Committee hearing focused on Attorney General William Barr and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross’s alleged refusal to comply with subpoenas associated with 2020 census citizenship questions.\n\nTlaib, much like her colleague Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), suggested the existence of ill-will behind the citizenship question. “This is about whether or not we as a country want to count every single person, no matter their status and so forth. But doing this, this is political motivation, this is very racialized,” she said. “This is because you don’t want communities like mine being represented here in this chamber equally,” she continued. “This is about that. And it really, it breaks my heart.” “Is it really about citizenship?” she asked, answering her own question with a resounding “no.” She took her accusations a step further, posing the motivation behind the citizenship question as a secret ploy to reduce minority participation. “It is about reducing the number of people of color in this country being counted in the census,” she declared. “That’s exactly what it is about. Because you want to cheat. He wants to cheat, Mr. Chairman. He wants to cheat this process. Well, not on our watch.” That isn’t a new argument. Many Democrats believe that a citizenship question would “force people into the shadows.” Proponents say a basic citizenship question is not new and believe Democrats are more concerned by the prospect of losing congressional seats.\n\nTlaib did not stop her criticism there.

Trump’s share of the African-American vote in that race surprised many because it was larger than the six percent Mitt Romney received in 2012.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) is unsettled by the House Democrats’ decision to hold off pursuing a bill that would have provided members of Congress with a pay raise, tweeting Tuesday a lack of action will result in more corruption in Congress.\n\nThe cap on congressional salaries has been frozen for the last decade. Given the positive state of the Trump economy, House Democrats were considering unfreezing the cap on congressional salaries and resuming the previously automatic cost-of-living increases as part of a broader $1 trillion spending bill. \nThe move would have provided members of Congress with a $4,500 raise next year.\n\nHowever, Democrat leadership decided to scrap consideration of the bill after rising concerns from other Democrats– particularly from freshmen Democrats in swing districts. Voting themselves a pay raise during an election year would look wildly out-of-touch, some political analysts warned. “Nobody wants to vote to give themselves a raise. There’s nothing good about that,” Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA) said, according to Politico.\n\nRep. Joe Cunningham (D-SC) also opposed the move and told House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on the floor that it was “bad politics and bad policy.” Hoyer did not take a strong stance either way, previously noting that there is “never” an ideal time for Congress to give itself a raise. “I don’t think there’s ever a time when people think it’s very good politically to do,” he said, according to Bloomberg. “In this present climate, where the president says we have one of the best economies in the entire history of the world, I don’t know.” House Democrats ultimately postponed discussion on the pay raise due to the internal conflict. Nevertheless, not all freshmen Democrats are worried about the optics of voting themselves a raise. Ocasio-Cortez is all for it. In fact, she’s seemingly upset that the proposal was shot down so quickly. \nWhile it might not be “politically popular,” members of Congress deserve the raise, Ocasio-Cortez said. She added that the lack of such a raise encourages corruption and “increases pressure on them to keep dark money loopholes open.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/51007d1affc22766572d85a22a35e14a/5E638F53/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.37.1312.1312a/s640x640/64503663_2370375666573967_5996121011043444475_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Byk2TjFHTm_/", "caption": "🤣🤣They NEVER learn!🤣🤣 Just like every other award show in the Trump-era, Broadway’s Tony Awards just hit a record low in the ratings.\n\nFor the first time ever, reports the far-left Hollywood Reporter, fewer than six million tuned in to Sunday’s telecast of the Tony Awards.

The operation tracked financial movements from October 2018 through current dates in an attempt to determine the sources of funding for the migrant caravans. According to their statement, the UIF identified a group of individuals that made several questionable international financial transactions from the cities of Chiapas and Queretaro during the times that the migrant caravans were moving through those places. Mexican authorities followed the path of the caravans and the financial operations from Queretaro to the border cities of Tijuana, Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Ciudad Acuna, Piedras Negras, and Reynosa. Based on that information, Mexican authorities were able to trace the source of the funds to the U.S., England, Cameroon, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, the statement revealed.\n\nBased on the result of the investigation, the UIF moved to freeze the accounts in Mexico of the 26 individuals and entities that are believed to have helped fund the migrant caravans or contributed to human smuggling organizations, the SHCP statement revealed.  While authorities did not name the individuals or the entities whose assets they froze, they revealed that they would be filing complaints with Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office for prosecution.

We need to stand up for the American values of compassion and diversity that have made this country stronger.” Feinstein said the 440,000 foreign nationals who would receive the amnesty have “earned the right” to permanently stay in the U.S. “The Senate needs to follow the House’s lead and pass these important protections for immigrant families who have been living and working in the United States for decades,” Feinstein said. “After fleeing wars and natural disasters, these families have established deep roots in our communities and earned the right to remain together here in the United States.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dd38d7f93b9bb5fbff1a8d0b1d6f3ac8/5E4BA174/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.61.1355.1355a/s640x640/61617607_198826011103189_3242719058333851360_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BygSRPLncYe/", "caption": "🔴Cracking Down on Food Stamp Fraud🔴 Six Ohio residents are accused of carrying out an $8.5 million food stamp fraud scheme, according to prosecutors.\n\nOf the seven people accused of running a food stamp fraud scheme through a local food delivery business, six of them pled guilty while one pled not guilty. \nThe owner of the business, Kaitlin Koher, 32, of Jackson Township, pled not guilty and will be due back in court later in July, the Canton Repository reported.\n\nCourt documents state that the business, Ohio Direct Distributors, conducted an $8.5 million food stamp fraud scheme using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP) benefits between August 2011 and September 2017.\n\nThe documents state that up to 93 percent of the company’s transactions could be considered fraudulent.\n\nFederal investigators say that these store owners used SNAP recipients to trade benefits for cash and often “completed transactions without the individual recipient’s knowledge or consent,” the court filings said.\n\nFood stamp fraud is quite commonplace among convenience stores in the U.S. and is one of the ways the federal government loses billions of dollars each year.\n\nA Government Accountability Office (GAO) report from 2019 found that criminals were responsible for trafficking at least $1 billion in food stamp benefits.\n\nLast March, Florida law enforcement officials busted nearly 200 people on food stamp fraud charges while they carried out an undercover law enforcement investigation.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/528bd0d9ad46e22b8e8e22064e02eb79/5E51ADAA/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.29.1298.1298a/s640x640/61853294_843133289419698_4938645726549742020_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BygMVLCn6DE/", "caption": "Katy Perry has “blood on her hands,” according to a nun who has been in a tumultuous battle for years with the pop superstar over the purchase of a Los Angeles convent.\n\nThe “Swish Swish” singer purchased the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary from Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez for $14.5 million roughly four years ago, but the lone surviving nun of that convent does not believe the sale is legitimate.\n\nThe nuns originally accepted an offer from a local restaurant owner, but Gomez, they said, sold the property under their nose.

These children are often older, or have special needs, which make them more difficult to place permanently. Pro-life organization Live Action observed that as many companies are rushing to support abortion, Wendy’s is raising funds for adoptions. “Fast-food chain Wendy’s and its partner, the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, has at its heart the interests of the children who are frequently trotted out as ‘reasons to abort’ — those who are in foster care waiting to be adopted,” Live Action @liveactionorg noted. The foundation’s website notes the words of Dave Thomas himself: “These children are not someone else’s responsibility. They are our responsibility.” The foundation, which has partnered with Snapchat through the Cause Cup program, states about 400,000 children live in foster care in the United States. Snapchat users scan their phone over the fast-food chain’s cameo on the restaurant’s beverage cups. Once the marker is detected, Wendy’s will donate five dollars to the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption. “[W]e believe that every child deserves a permanent home and loving family,” the foundation says. “The work the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption does through Wendy’s Wonderful Kids – its signature program – has helped more than 8,500 children find their forever families.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d91d04aa9f9e56613400e7cf6175cbca/5E577C7A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.111.1433.1433a/s640x640/61697501_398153130777009_7036825737703308956_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BydTAmlnivR/", "caption": "A woman from Palmetto, Florida, told law enforcement that her hatred for President Donald Trump drove her to stab herself in the stomach multiple times over the weekend, according to a police report.\n\nThe Smoking Gun reports police discovered the unnamed woman covered in blood near her home on Sunday.

Such a rate of illegal immigration would also take the U.S. back to levels not seen since Fiscal Year 2006, when President Bush oversaw massive totals of border crossings.\n\nMeanwhile, Acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan has admitted that his agency is merely acting as a checkpoint for illegal aliens, with all adult border crossers arriving with children getting released into the interior of the U.S.mere months’ time, these adult border crossers — now living freely in the country — are receiving work permits to take U.S. jobs.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a3d0381fafbbd2f08950493d275cfcf6/5E56E700/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.121.1440.1440a/s640x640/60771108_418237115397829_5781136540949664570_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByXk2nqn0o7/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/24013460256cfe396128f2c2d04b8c6a/5DC1A9BC/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/61080996_694619477625649_1073414290375452684_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByXkotknhdo/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a203529449bdc1a4d40b14b66e6ac47a/5DC10EA4/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/61467637_404897886775072_9010415717615700129_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWsbL2Hp6m/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e7ba7890aa8421eb2403c8a0105a633f/5E59499E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/60568620_130485014814896_7273717783634881246_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByWEJvUnURS/", "caption": "🔴Donald Trump Jr. DESTROYS Biden on feckless China posture!🔴 Donald Trump Jr. @donaldjtrumpjr tweeted on Wednesday that former Vice President Joe Biden is “incentivized” to dismiss the threat posed by China because of his son’s business dealings with the Chinese government.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, has identified himself as one of the victims in the case. The staff of Sen. Susan Collins of Maine confirmed Monday to The Associated Press that she also received threatening messages from DeRisi.\n\nGrassley served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when it advanced Kavanaugh’s nomination last year; Collins cast a decisive vote in Kavanaugh’s favor. “Threatening to harm or kill elected officials because one disagrees with their public positions goes far beyond the scope of the First Amendment and will not be tolerated,” Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said in a news release.\n\nDeRisi’s attorneys described him as an “angry, sick old man” who suffers from dementia but does not pose a risk of violence.

Kavanaugh denied claims during the hearing that he sexually assaulted California psychologist Christine Blasey Ford.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ac23633255024fa862fc1c0b89b84671/5E47B8E0/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.114.1439.1439a/s640x640/61498844_139861987190271_5942949487123689837_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByS-ZxDnMZR/", "caption": "Brexit leader Nigel Farage @big el_farage has been seen entering the U.S. Ambassador’s residence in London just 30 minutes after President Donald Trump arrived at the stately home aboard Marine One.\n\nThe days leading up to this week’s State Visit to the United Kingdom by President Donald Trump have been populated with intense speculation over whether any off-schedule meetings with non-government British political figures might take place, but the arrival of Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage at the U.S. Ambassador’s residence does suggest at least one will go ahead.\n\nUPDATE 18125 — Nigel’s comments in full\n\nTurns out Mr Farage had a private meeting with both President Trump and U.S. Ambassador Johnson.

Chao and her husband have directly benefited from the Chao family business. As Schweizer recounts in Secret Empires, Chao’s father—and Mitch McConnell’s father-in-law—gave the Washington power couple a “gift” (that is the term used on McConnell’s financial disclosure forms to report this transaction) of between $5 to $25 million in 2008. According to the New York Post, the “gift” had a major impact on the couple’s net worth: “In 2004, current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his wife, current U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, had an average net worth of $3.1 million. Ten years later, that number had increased to somewhere between $9.2 million and $36.5 million.” Schweizer’s research also details how the Chao family’s fortunes have risen in conjunction with Elaine Chao and Mitch McConnell’s political clout. Beginning in 2007, “just as the U.S. Senate was taking up sensitive legislation concerning China,” Schweizer reports that the Chinese government’s CSSC Holdings, Ltd.—the financial arm of the Chinese government’s military contractor CSSC—named James Chao to its board. CSSC Holdings also added Elaine Chao’s sister Angela Chao to its board as well. The Times notes that these board memberships are “a rarity for foreigners.” “The fact that both the father-in-law and sister-in-law of Senator McConnell sat on the board of CSSC Holdings is highly unusual, to say the least,” writes Schweizer. “One could say it is unprecedented....”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e6f2767e8c9b3b4f21dec2cbb81beb47/5E4A7F79/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/61598727_324645161770416_8083485362811203629_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByQWvhMnwMj/", "caption": "🇺🇸 🇬🇧 First Lady Melania Trump @flotus met Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Charles, and Camilla Parker Bowles at Buckingham Palace in London, England, on Monday, in an iconic white hat and matching skirt suit. 🇺🇸🇬🇧 📷: Getty/AP/AFP", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/99549fcb7f756519d43c1972666b5e6b/5E510D61/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/60497131_438669323612884_8842666343310251551_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/ByQR6aLHQFI/", "caption": "🍿🤣Pop some popcorn, y’all...this is gonna be fun to watch.🍿🤣 Hillary Clinton has reportedly criticized 2020 presidential candidate Sen.

According to Adams, Clinton has “no good words for Sanders, writing that the Obama-era secretary of state believes “Anyone overtaking him in a district considered his, he’ll burn the place down.” Clinton has blamed her own election loss to President Trump on former President Barack Obama, fired FBI Director James Comey, the Democrat National Committee (DNC), and the nation of Russia. She has also blamed Sanders, who begrudgingly endorsed her, declaring at the time that she “will make an outstanding president.” Though Sanders did not endorse Clinton as quickly or enthusiastically as she may have liked, he did not attack her during the primary as strongly as he could have. The socialist senator defended his opponent’s illegal use of an unsecured “homebrew” email server to conduct official business as Secretary of State, and he largely declined to pick up on “pay-to-play” allegations surrounding the Clinton Foundation — particularly Clinton’s involvement in the sale of 20% of America’s uranium to Russia. Judging by the Vermont senator’s recent remarks, there looks to be no love lost between him and Clinton.

The media outlet said it “will be working with Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll throughout 2019.” While the poll results show 46 percent of Americans say the Supreme Court should uphold the 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade, in which the high court created a right to abortion, 49 percent expect the Supreme Court to modify the landmark ruling. “Almost half of Americans believe the Supreme Court will modify but not repeal Roe vs. Wade while a plurality of Americans, just short of a majority, would like it affirmed,” said Mark Penn, co-director of the Harvard CAPS/Harris poll. The full poll results were not yet available online at the time of publication.\n\nOther recent polls have found more Americans are in favor of restrictions on abortion, even those who label themselves “pro-choice.” In January, a Marist Poll found 75 percent of Americans favor substantial restrictions on abortion, including 60 percent of Democrats and 61 percent of those who identify as “pro-choice.” According to that poll, 75 percent of Americans say abortion should be limited to — at most — the first three months of pregnancy.

The book, We’ve Got People: From Jesse Jackson to AOC, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a Movement, has already landed a few other major blows, including on former President Barack Obama, regarding his “don’t ask, don’t tell” repeal legacy, but this revelation about Biden’s torrid history with race–as told from the left–is particularly damning for the current Democrat 2020 presidential primary front runner. “Joe Biden, elected to the Senate in 1972, was a leading voice in the attempt to win back white working-class voters by showing them how tough Democrats could be against affirmative [action], school integration, and other priorities of the civil rights movement,” Grim writes. He added:\n“I do not buy the concept, popular in the ’60s, which said, “We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a head start, or even hold the white man back, to even the race.

This month, thowever, Chemirmir was charged with murdering 11 other elderly women, all between the ages of 76 to 94-years-old. The illegal alien worked as a home healthcare worker and was a home aide to many of the women.\n\nA law enforcement source confirmed to Breitbart News that Chemirmir first arrived in the U.S. on a B-2 visa — commonly known as a tourist visa — in July 2003. Though Chemirmir was supposed to only temporarily be in the U.S., he overstayed his visa and became an illegal alien who was eligible for deportation.\n\nRather than being deported, however the illegal alien was able to use a loophole in the country’s legal immigration system that allowed him to obtain a green card after marrying a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn November 2007, Chemirmir was approved for a green card allowing him to permanently resettle in the country. Every year, more than 1.2 million legal immigrants are admitted to the U.S.\n\nA law enforcement source also said the illegal alien had a criminal record, including convictions for drunk driving, trespassing, assault, and obstructing a police officer. Chemirmir has been formally charged with the string of murders of elderly women across the region, but police have said that there could be more victims. Currently, investigators are looking into about 750 deaths of elderly women in the area.\n\nChemirmir has remained in custody since last year on a $1 million bond.\n\nAs of March, there were more than 415,000 illegal aliens in the U.S. who had overstayed their visas.

Last August the former Vatican nuncio to the United States, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, released an 11-page report in which he declared he had personally informed Pope Francis about McCarrick’s misdeeds in 2013 but that Francis had restored him to a position of trust, consulting him regarding the naming of future U.S. bishops.

However, proponents of the idea argue that free mental health care and substance abuse treatment could help remedy those problems, as many homeless people suffer mental illness and drug addiction.\n\nThe city already offers free health insurance to uninsured residents through a program called “Healthy San Francisco.” The new program, to be dubbed “Mental Health SF,” would be paid for with “a proposed tax increase on companies that pay their chief executive officers 100 times more than the median compensation paid to their employees,” KQED reports, citing the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe new proposal comes as state lawmakers are debating whether to expand health insurance to illegal aliens up to the age of 26 and over the age of 65.

Of 105 terrorist incidents during the three weeks covered by this report, Breitbart News was unable to determine which group carried out ten that resulted in 25 deaths and 47 injuries.

I think that’s one of the most important things I could do.” In October 2018, Swift shocked the entertainment world by breaking her long-held silence on politics with an endorsement of Bredesen for U.S. Senate and Democrat Jim Cooper for U.S. House of Representatives, citing their record on LGBT issues. “As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn,” Shake It Off singer wrote. “Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.” While Blackburn prevailed over Bredesen, Swift’s social media posts led to an increase in voter registration across the country, BuzzFeed reported at the time. “We are up to 65,000 registrations in a single 24-hour period since T.

Before winning a seat in Congress, she had called Israel an “apartheid regime,” and tweeted: “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.” (She has since deleted the tweet.) She backs the “boycott, divestment, sanctions” (BDS) movement against Israel — despite telling voters in 2018 that she did not. Nevertheless, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) appointed Omar to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where she has continued to cause controversy — not just regarding Israel, but other issues as well.\n\nIn January, for example, Omar referred to Venezuela’s socialist opposition as “far right,” and blamed U.S. sanctions for that country’s economic woes, rather than the dictatorial behavior or the socialist economic policies of Nicolas Maduro’s regime.\n\nIn April, Omar appeared to downplay the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, saying that “some people did something.” Omar has also repeatedly used antisemitic rhetoric in Congress. In February, she claimed, falsely, that a pro-Israel group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), bribed members of Congress to support Israel (“It’s all about the Benjamins”). She apologized after pressure from party leaders. Nevertheless, Pelosi has rejected calls to remove Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nIt is not clear exactly what Omar believes “the perspective of a foreigner” means.

This is just the beginning.” Media reports that the Tories suffered their worst election result in two centuries, dropping to just nine per cent of the vote and winning only four seats — losing 15 — while the Labour Party is said to have had its worst election result in 100 years, halving its presence in the European Parliament from 20 to just ten seats.\n\nSpeaking to Good Morning Britain on Monday morning, Mr Farage warned that the establishment political parties will suffer in the next General Election, scheduled for 2021, if they fail to take the UK out of the EU by October 31st, saying: “That date will become a bigger factor in peoples’ minds as these five months go by. If we don’t leave on the 31st of October, then the Brexit Party will go on to a General Election and stun everybody there, too.” The Brexit Party leader later told the BBC that his party would be ready for even an October snap General Election, saying that it “might not be easy, but that work starts this afternoon.” Recent polling of Westminster voting intentions point to the Brexit Party being ahead of the Conservative Party and just two points away from taking the lead over Labour.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d69643af3d98001c88d9d08230596ffb/5E4A425F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.114.1439.1439a/s640x640/60552602_675380856260562_209245562965147825_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx9zOXZHto6/", "caption": "🇺🇸MEMORIAL DAY: For every Soldier, Sailor, Airman, and Marine who sacrificed their life so that we may live free...thank you.🇺🇸 #memorialday #weremember #army #navy #airforce #marines", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/d253986e09220fbc30d75c998a64e8a7/5E3F5BA8/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.0.958.958a/s640x640/60097659_697010597401750_3972573808702246919_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx8X8oKnxFV/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/80aaf0225aed38592ff21612b1ee5986/5DC1E544/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/60120809_339992963334013_5666820774663108688_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx8XZdgHMOK/", "caption": "Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Rep.

My own life these past twelve months has been particularly rewarding in terms of the opportunities I’ve had and the projects on which I’ve worked. None of it would have been possible without their service and sacrifice.\n\nWhile it is never appropriate to compare the service of current civilian members of government with that of fallen soldiers, the weekend does bring to mind the general virtues and attributes of duty, honor, dedication, and loyalty. These are not just personified in our military but can be found in others who devote their careers to representing their nation in non-combat roles. It is with that backdrop that I turn my keyboard’s attention to the United States’ Ambassador to Germany, Richard (Ric) Grenell @richardgrenell The role of Ambassador of the United States to a foreign country has historically been one of mixed use and seriousness. The position has sometimes been awarded as a pure act of political patronage, it has been awarded ceremonially, and it has been awarded substantively for the purpose of placing a serious person in a role to make a serious contribution. Ambassador Grenell certainly falls under that last heading. Since his appointment to the post he currently holds in May of 2018, Ambassador Grenell has made it clear he has no intentions of holding a ceremonial position and hosting dinner parties serving blutwurst and kraut. The Ambassador went in with a clear understanding of his role: to carry out the president’s agenda regardless of how uncomfortable it might make his German hosts. This is a role made easier for him by the fact that he and the president share the same ideas as to the United States’ role proper role in the world.\n\nOne year in on his assignment, he has become the Berlin-based version of President Trump, willing to make strong stands that do not compromise on principle and which hold our German allies accountable for the actions that impact the United States and others.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c867f26e79daa88df63d23f3a678e04c/5E4F1079/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.120.1440.1440a/s640x640/60237896_2263758000508250_3220395775944904688_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx8Ea9Any5f/", "caption": "🇺🇸UPDATE: President Trump vows to protect Rolling Thunder!🇺🇸 More than 100,000 flag-bearing bikers, many of them Vietnam veterans, throttled their engines Sunday for the annual “Rolling Thunder” ride through the capital as President Donald Trump vowed to keep the Memorial Day spectacle alive.\n\nSpectators lined the route from the Pentagon to the National Mall to watch the growling parade of choppers, a leather-clad, red-white-and-blue tribute to American soldiers missing in the Vietnam War.\n\nIt had been billed as the last national Rolling Thunder ride by its organizers, but Trump, who loves a parade, appeared to offer a reprieve. “The Great Patriots of Rolling Thunder WILL be coming back to Washington, D.C. next year, & hopefully for many years to come.

The order ensures that federal agencies will enforce the existing 1996 laws which seek to save American taxpayers by having their public welfare funding benefits reimbursed when they are used by a legal immigrant.\n\nThe first function of the order mandates that a family member or business sponsor of a legal immigrant looking to permanently resettle in the U.S. is responsible for paying back the welfare costs previously used by that immigrant. For example, if a visa holder has used $10,000 in food stamp benefits while living in the U.S., when a family member sponsors them for a green card, that family member will be notified of the legal immigrant’s welfare costs to taxpayers and obligated to pay back the amount.\n\nIf the sponsor of a legal immigrant does not pay the welfare cost, the Treasury Offset Program will take the money out of the sponsor’s taxes for that year. Federal officials said implementation of this order would begin in September.\n\nA senior administration official told Breitbart News that the order to enforce Clinton’s 1996 law will drive down welfare-dependent legal immigration to the U.S. which has cost American taxpayers billions over the years. “This is a historic, transformative action to restore the foundational principle of U.S. immigration law: that those seeking to join our society must support themselves financially,” the official said. “This executive action will dramatically curb ‘welfare tourism’ and protect U.S. benefits for U.S. families,” the official continued.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/bddb8a745a5f7de41a90bfd96e6cb4d1/5E50A5A2/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.98.1414.1414a/s640x640/60418739_528846310977712_2556623268284616303_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx0KqVMnRu4/", "caption": "🔶BOMBSHELL🔶 In the inaugural episode of @drilldowntv , investigator and bestselling author Peter Schweizer revealed the foreign influence peddling scandal engulfing Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign in a new video series produced by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Institute (GAI).

Babies are not babies until they are born,” it declares. Far from guaranteeing fair or “neutral” language, the NPR guide plants itself firmly on the side of the abortion lobby.\n\nNPR’s guide to speaking about abortion coincides perfectly with the guide produced by abortion giant Planned Parenthood, which aims to manipulate public opinion about abortion by controlling the language used to describe it.

However, the article does at least acknowledge that the deals occurred. “Hunter Biden and a business partner, Devon Archer, were involved in a fund that reportedly pursued an investment from the Chinese government-owned Bank of China,” the Times states. The Times continues: “The fund was announced in late 2013 — days after Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew to China from Japan aboard Air Force Two with the vice president, who was in the midst of a diplomatic mission intended to calm rising tensions in the region. During the trip, Vice President Biden warned Chinese leaders not to use fighter jets to enforce an air defense zone created by Beijing over contested waters.\n\nThe conservative author Peter Schweizer has claimed that Hunter Biden used the trip to secure a deal with the Bank of China — a claim that has been echoed by Mr. Trump’s allies in the conservative news media.\n\nBut a lawyer for Hunter Biden said he did not conduct any business related to the China investment fund on that trip, and was not an equity owner in the fund while his father was vice president. He later acquired a 10 percent interest in the entity that oversees the fund, but to date has not received any money from the arrangement, according to the lawyer.” The Times fails to note basic facts about Biden and his associates that would challenge their version of events or, at the very least, offer readers context to assess the veracity of their claims.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c2df23a5fc1422e01c6160b1dbb6ddf0/5E4611A7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1431.1431a/s640x640/59253122_2376605035995076_708184294889007965_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxw1dETnP51/", "caption": "⬛️If only Hollywood were as passionate about innocent children as they are...chickens.⬛️ Some 25 actors, models, and professional athletes joined forces for a PSA from Mercy For Animals, urging viewers to demand McDonald’s “eliminate the worst cruelty for their chickens.” Among an assortment of animal rights activists demanding that you “take action,” the video features the likes of actor James Cromwell, electronic music DJ Moby, former NBA star John Salley, and actors Ignacio Serricchio, Mark Hapka, James Kyson, Alexandra Paul, Kimberly Elise, Daisy Fuentes, Daniella Monet, Emily Deschanel, among many others.

Their report, titled, “The Ties That Bind: Is Faith a Global Force for Good or Ill in the Family?” was published by the Institute for Family Studies and the Wheatley Institution. “When it comes to relationship quality, there is a J-curve in women’s marital happiness, with women on the left and the right enjoying higher quality marriages than those in the middle — but especially wives on the right,” the authors explained. They continued that American wives who are in the middle, both religiously and ideologically, as well as secular conservative wives, are less likely to experience high-quality marriages: “We suspect that part of their relative unhappiness, compared with religiously conservative women, is that they don’t enjoy the social, emotional and practical support for family life provided by a church, mosque or synagogue. We also suspect that these groups are less likely to have husbands who have made the transition to the “new father” ideal that’s gained currency in modern America — and they’re not happy with their partner’s disengagement.” Following behind religious conservative wives, 60 percent of highly religious progressive wives said they were “very happy.” Among secular liberal couples, 55 percent of married women reported above-average relationship quality, while 33 percent of women in traditional secular marriages reported the same.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/07c96f1aa7447d4e1086878c34952025/5E58E04A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.20.1282.1282a/s640x640/60265553_134055597688574_2681127375467056449_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxu0s2oHgdE/", "caption": "Monday on his nationally syndicated radio program, conservative commentator Mark Levin blasted Rep.

Predictably, liberals don’t seem interested in believing these victims.\n\nThe appeal was announced on Wednesday and includes a tool to monitor Big Tech censorship. This is welcome news for conservatives and anyone concerned about the trend of censorship by the giant social media and search engine companies. It’s proof positive that Donald Trump is very serious about stopping the suppression of conservative speech on social media, as he alluded to in a recent tweet, when he said, “Social Media & Fake News Media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves. VERY UNFAIR!” The mainstream media response to the new White House initiative, however, expressed precious little concern over the notion that the tech oligopoly is abusing its power over ordinary Americans, instead trying to gaslight us by implying that social media censorship is all in our heads.\n\nI wasn’t surprised. That’s been the fake news’s consistent stance throughout Big Tech’s campaign to banish voices on the right from the modern public square and shift the terms of the debate in favor of their Democratic allies.\n\nLuckily, after years of ever-tightening censorship against conservatives and Trump supporters, that narrative is so transparently false that it’s impossible to take seriously... We have mountains of direct evidence that Big Tech is seeking to swing political debate in this country leftward. We know from conscientious whistleblowers that Big Tech employees discuss censoring conservatives in the coarsest terms. Just this week, we learned that a Google subsidiary is working closely with the disgraced Southern Poverty Law Center to create automated artificial intelligence tools to reduce “toxicity” in online comments... With your help and the submission of concrete examples of their bias, we’ll be ready to call that bluff. \nSo go to wh.gov/techbias today, and let the White House know about every time you’ve been unfairly silenced and censored online.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e22272719c3ace3d5d2c34ecd424cbcc/5E406FE5/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.120.1440.1440a/s640x640/60629960_292771304961133_4500233776047155004_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxsbDUNHGTx/", "caption": "At a rally where Nigel Farage @nigel_farage implored campaigners to be “happy warriors” in the final days of the EU election campaign, the Brexit Party leader invited scrutiny of the foreign funding of the anti-Brexit campaign.\n\nSpeaking during a cross-country day of rallies, Mr Farage told Breitbart London closer scrutiny of the funding of Remain-supporting campaign groups would likely reveal “lots of George Soros’s money”, among other sources.

Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Letter from a Birmingham Jail could be read today in response to pro-life conservatives who are concerned that Alabama’s recently passed Human Life Protection Act could harm Republicans in the 2020 election. “I hope it isn’t presumptuous of me for saying this, but when I was hearing people saying, ‘This is untimely and this is unwise,’ the first thing that came to my mind was your uncle’s famous Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” Mansour said. “He makes a brilliant argument in that letter that the time to fight against injustice is always right now.” King agreed and pointed to another famous quote from her uncle: “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” “America is right to be concerned,” King said of the abortion debate around the nation, but she argued that the pro-life laws in states like Alabama and George “won’t hurt” Republicans in 2020. “Now, people are saying, ‘They’re going to put women in jail.’ Absolutely not,” King said. “But doctors who insist on continuing to abort little people in the womb will have to answer, because the doctors themselves medically know that that is a person. That is a human being. Ultrasound shows that to all of us, now, and science has caught up with us.” King said, “In most instances, mothers have been either coerced — sometimes even [in the case of] rape or incest — and are forced into abortions, or at least confused and under stress and pressure.

Wade,” summarized state Sens. Dave Schatz and Caleb Rowden in a joint statement.\n\nThe bill’s approval by the Republican-led state Senate, with a vote of 24-10, came just hours after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed into law a bill that bans most abortions at any time during pregnancy, except those necessary in order to prevent “a serious health risk to the unborn child’s mother.” The Missouri legislation now heads to the Republican-led House for approval, before it can go to the desk of Gov.

Ralph Abraham is fighting every day to make sure that we follow President Trump’s example so that Louisiana can finally start winning again.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c1fc51b7fc98b8bd52cb469ce6ce33ad/5E53F413/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/59927656_397372534182742_6928395545325919559_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdWZ2RndiX/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/122fde439d55d95217914e16e00a95b2/5DC1F9C5/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/58666187_424163661768931_1094643307203477023_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdLAgvHKy9/", "caption": "🔴TOMORROW at 8 A.M.

In Ukraine, it involved an energy company called Burisma, which is a very corrupt organization headed by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky who is very close to ViktorYanukovich, the pro-Russian leader.” Schweizer asked, “There’s all kinds of questions and implications. Is there a Russian component to this, because Burisma is such a corrupt company?” “The bottom line is Joe Biden was the Obama administration’s point-person on policy towards Ukraine,” noted Schweizer. “He steered $1.8 billion in aid to that government and while he was doing so, his son got a sweetheart deal with this energy company – that we’ve been able to trace over just a 14-month period – paid $3.1 million into an account where Hunter Biden was getting paid.” Schweizer highlighted Hunter Biden’s lack of professional or experiential bona fides in terms of his board position at Burisma Holdings. “Suffice to say, Hunter Biden has no background in Ukraine,” stated Schweizer. “He has no background in energy policy. There’s really no legitimate explanation as to why he got this deal with this energy company, other than the fact his father was responsible for doling out money in Ukraine itself.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c43d565075953a66974c1aed1f8a8fc0/5E437214/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/59950516_2329554547288037_3384161142058616861_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxcpEw4nS_T/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8d36d0b962e098b59999579cb68cbc26/5DC1C5B9/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/59828811_376380932981453_505790968863117821_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxcnMa2nsn4/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b726bb2012e3aaab9afc4a00f77ff3c1/5DC1D27D/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/58922571_2250190421726717_5320862107401060699_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxckhV3HRZi/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8b03dfecfa150bb74928fbbbe07746a3/5DC1DC64/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/60498020_670749016711597_706730408925907531_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxcacd3Hkvf/", "caption": "🔴Look how carefully parsed Joe Biden’s “denial” is.🔴 Former Vice President Joe Biden denied Monday that his son Hunter Biden asked him for a favor in Ukraine while serving on the energy board of a Ukrainian energy company. “We never once discussed it when he was there,” Biden told the Associated Press. “There’s not a single bit of evidence that’s been shown in any reporting that’s been done that he ever talked about it with me or asked any government official for a favor.” When he was vice president, Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine if officials did not fire the country’s top prosecutor, who was pursuing a corruption investigation of an energy company while his son Hunter was serving on the board. The connection was revealed in author Peter Schweizer’s best-selling book Secret Empires, and the reporting was confirmed in the New York Times.\n\nHunter Biden was paid as much as $50,000 per month while serving on the board, as his father led the Obama administration’s policy with Ukraine.\n\nBiden’s “not a single bit of evidence” defense echoes former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s repeated assertion that there was no evidence of improper paybacks after she approved the Uranium One deal — despite receiving $145 million in pledges and donations for the Clinton Foundation. Biden’s Ukraine connection made recent headlines after President Donald Trump’s personal attorney suggested he would travel to Ukraine to investigate the issue before ultimately deciding against it.\n\nBiden criticized Giuliani for even considering the idea. “I can’t remember any lawyer representing the president, conferring with the president, deciding to go overseas, where a government relies on U.S. largesse to try to get them to do something that everybody knows never happened,” Biden said during an interview with WMUR.\n\nIn the same interview, he also pointed to the reporting surrounding the conflict of interest. “All the reports indicated that not a single, solitary thing was inappropriate about what my son did.

But guess what, they’re not competition for us.” Perhaps Biden’s insouciant attitude toward the Chinese government has to do with the fact that his family does not consider them competitors but business partners.\n\nIn 2013, then-Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden flew aboard Air Force Two to China. Less than two weeks later, Hunter Biden’s firm inked a $1 billion private equity deal with a subsidiary of the Chinese government’s Bank of China. The deal was later expanded to $1.5 billion. In short, the Chinese government funded a business that it co-owned along with the son of a sitting vice president.  If it sounds shocking that a vice president would shape US-China policy as his son — who has scant experience in private equity — clinched a coveted billion-dollar deal with an arm of the Chinese government, that’s because it is.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ee878d56c2c14adb17c84e87ba1a92fb/5E428DDC/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.179.1440.1440a/s640x640/60558822_349941542386139_445530090834156721_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxYR-nznAM1/", "caption": "Yankees fans are calling for a boycott in response to the team’s banning of Kate Smith’s version of God Bless America.

Remove the plaques from Monument Park,” Foley scoffed. Kate Smith’s remaining family is grateful for the support.\n\nSmith’s niece, Suzy Andron, told the Post that she hopes the decision will be reversed and that it was all just a “misunderstanding.” “Most are solidly behind the positive notion that this is a misunderstanding by a few people who took two or three of her songs [out of 3,000 that she recorded] out of context,” she said, “and inflated a story that my Aunt Kathryn must have been a racist.” Saying that it is unfortunate that the Yankees “bought into” the absurd idea that Smith was a racist, Andron added, “Most reasonable people realize that it was a misunderstood, knee-jerk over-reaction which they hope will be corrected soon.” The Yankees are not the only team to ban Smith. Despite decades of using God Bless America as a rallying point for the team, the Philadelphia Flyers also banned Smith for “racism.” Fans in Philly, though, are just as incensed as fans in New York.

The memos were unearthed a few days ago through open-records litigation by the conservative group Citizens United.” Solomon followed up on that report Thurs with another detail from the document — which FBI Director Christopher Wray has redacted all but three sentences of.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/aa09e6ce58db35a4b7ce7f8a67a5d4a1/5E5555EE/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.108.1429.1429a/s640x640/59583088_130202251493551_4636480153589348722_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxR1c0_n3JH/", "caption": "Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute and senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News, described the news media and political establishment’s disinterest in Hunter Biden’s business deals with foreign states “stunning.” Schweizer contrasted this disinterest with the treatment of Donald Trump Jr.’s @donaldjtrumpjr “deal that actually never happened” in the Trump Organization’s contemplated construction of a skyscraper in Moscow, Russia.\n“Hunter Biden actually has real deals.

In the case of the Trumps, no deal was consummated. The second difference, of course, was that the Bidens were in political office [and] had political power. The Trumps didn’t.

Mueller found no evidence of collusion, or conspiracy, between President Trump’s campaign and the Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election–or between the Russians and any American for that matter–and did not find evidence of obstruction of justice, effectively clearing the president on all counts.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) @marcorubiofla told Breitbart News in a conversation Monday.\n\nRubio, who has become one of the most prominent voices in Congress on the spread of communist ideology in 21st century Latin America and plays a key role advising the White House on Venezuela, added that Maduro’s decision to shut down three of the country’s private airports in the aftermath of the uprising led by legitimate Venezuelan President Juan Guaidó indicates he suspects at least some around him are plotting their betrayal. Rubio claimed Maduro forced all those in his inner circle to take polygraph tests after they stood accused of negotiating their escape with the United States in exchange for helping end Maduro’s regime. He lists among the most important players keeping the Maduro regime in power figures like Tareck El Aissami, considered Hezbollah’s representative in the country; cocaine kingpin Diosdado Cabello; and Delcy Rodríguez, who recently warned starved Venezuelans not to eat food sent by the United States because it allegedly contained “chemical weapons.” Maduro typically rotates those in power from job to job, so all three have been at one time Venezuela’s vice president. Rodríguez holds the position currently.\n\nUnlike Maduro, most of his inner circle is not loyal to socialist/communist ideology, a key vulnerability for Maduro, according to Rubio. “Maduro is most certainly ideological, I mean, he wants to transition Venezuela to a Cuban-style system of governance, one party. He spent a lot of time in Cuba; it’s the reason the Cubans wanted him to be [late dictator Hugo] Chávez’s successor: because he is committed to that model,” Rubio told Breitbart News. “But the majority of the people in his inner circle, the key people, the seven to eight people that really hold up the regime, are not ideological, to varying degrees, but not like him.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/9f2602f85b52bca70196972c54a8700f/5E4B4EDF/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.120.1440.1440a/s640x640/58722679_296537394569139_4218274007505647397_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNV8WgHPyC/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0bb19898ca0c332d80246b4489e55534/5E624305/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/58410961_2345028492441647_53739087533779411_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxNTmCkHU96/", "caption": "Turning Point USA @turningpointusa representative Brittni Coffeen @coffeendamornin joined host Alex Marlow  @marlownews in a Wednesday interview on SiriusXM’s @siriusxm Breitbart News Daily for the weekly TPUSA campus report.

Prices of New York City real estate, which had fallen in each of the previous five years, had finally started to rise.\n\nApartment rental prices fell by 15 percent during the slump that had begun in 1988. The prices of co-ops and condos were down by nearly twice that much. Manhattan homes fell by 32.9 percent between 1989 and 1996, according to a study by the Furman Center for Real Estate & Urban Policy. In Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen — that westside stretch where Trump had invested so much in a plan to turn an old railyard into a new neighborhood — home prices fell 40.4 percent. The giant Canadian real estate company Olympia & York had declared bankruptcy. At one point, it had been the largest landlord in New York. By 1992, it had fired its bankers from J.P. Morgan and hired Felix G. Rohatyn, the guy who had saved New York City itself from the brink of bankruptcy in the 1970s. In the end, it would be swallowed up by its creditors, vanishing into the ash heap of history.\n\nBanks were getting crushed. New Jersey’s largest savings association was seized by federal regulators after real estate losses. Wall Street was scrambling, with real-estate king Goldman Sachs suddenly finding it could not raise money from investors for real estate projects “Even Goldman, which has dominated the business on Wall Street, is telling many of its real estate bankers to look for new jobs,” a news story noted in 1991.

Josh Hawley @joshhawleymo (R-MO), one of the most vocal critics of the big tech Masters of the Universe in the U.S. Senate, delivered a speech at the Hoover Institution last weekend highlighting the dangers posed by social media business models to American society. Sen. Hawley questioned whether Silicon Valley was as valuable to America as it is often portrayed. “One of the most difficult things about acting in this area is the fear that any significant change in this space, any significant adjustment to the rules of the road, whether it be privacy requirements or content requirements, might end up stifling Silicon Valley, which we are accustomed to regarding — certainly we’re told — is the great crown jewel of the American economy. But is it?” “Is this really the best that our best minds have to offer?” Sen. Hawley went on to argue that the social media economy may not be a “source of strength for America’s tomorrow, but … rather a source of peril.” The Senator dubbed the business model of social media platforms as “attention arbitrage” — tech companies buying users’ attention and selling it to advertisers, “for the highest price of course.” “Now, arbitrage opportunities, as those of you familiar with markets know, are supposed to close, right? The market eventually determines something is off. How is it that this attention arbitrage in the social media market is preserved and renewed over and over again?” “And that’s where things get really scary, because it’s preserved by hijacking users’ neural circuitry to prevent rational decision making about what to click and how to spend time. Or, just to simplify that a little bit, it’s preserved through addiction.

They voted on social issues back in those days, and they finally realized that there was never really going to be any change on social issues, so they stopped voting on social issues, and instead now they vote on the same issues that all average Americans who supported Trump vote on: bringing jobs back to this country and fair trade deals.” “I think it’s great what [Donald Trump] is doing on China,” continued Falwell Jr. “I admire a president willing to be able to take a hit. The economy will take a hit when he fights these trade wars, but he knows long-term that the benefit to America will be much greater than any hit we take in the short-term. We’re getting ripped off with these bad trade deals. I think Evangelicals see that.” Falwell Jr. added, “[Evangelicals] see immigration as a big issue.

So they just quit, and they started voting on the same issues that working class Democrats and average Americans vote on, and it’s all the issues that Donald Trump ran on.” Falwell Jr. mocked left-wing and partisan Democrat political marketing of Joe Biden as a “middle class” advocate. “It really makes me laugh when Joe Biden talks about the middle class, like that’s who liberals want to help,” stated Falwell Jr. “In California, where the liberals rule, the middle class has just given up and left the state.

But beyond the bans on individuals, Facebook has deployed an even more terrifying tool of censorship — link-banning.\n\nThe mainstream media were, of course, tipped off about the bans in advance, and the Atlantic’s report contains the following eye-opening detail. Not only has Alex Jones’ personal account now been banned from Facebook, in addition to PrisonPlanet editor-in-chief and YouTube star Paul Joseph Watson, but all links to Infowars sites are now banned across the platform. Share Infowars too often, and you’ll be banned too.\n\nVia The Atlantic: “Infowars is subject to the strictest ban. Facebook and Instagram will remove any content containing Infowars videos, radio segments, or articles (unless the post is explicitly condemning the content), and Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share Infowars content and events promoting any of the banned extremist figures, according to a company spokesperson. (Twitter, YouTube, and Apple have also banned Jones and Infowars.)” This takes censorship on social media to altogether new levels. If you post Infowars content on Facebook or Facebook-owned Instagram, your post will be removed. If you post it repeatedly, you will be banned. Note the wording, too — you’ll be banned unless you’re condemning Infowars. Facebook is now brazenly using its power to reward certain political positions and punish others.\n\nThis isn’t censorship of an individual or a group over a violation of terms of service. It’s the wholesale ban of an independent media site, which for all the criticism levied against it, has had a major impact on the politics of the United States.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3ef3ec4d8afa460bc8e1ccb5d3bd49bd/5E641A1A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c17.0.1045.1045a/s640x640/56890525_478194742924382_8424506749526478471_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BxAOTJ7nepP/", "caption": "Senators on Thursday confirmed the 100th judge nominated by President Donald Trump, marking a major milestone in the president’s pledge to replenish the federal courts with judges like the late originalist icon Antonin Scalia.\n\nThe full Senate on Thursday confirmed Rodolfo Ruiz to be a district judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. While that name does not ring a bell with most Americans – and while that  court might not seem like a major national concern – Ruiz’s confirmation to that federal trial court represents something big regarding one of the top reasons voters sent President Trump to the White House. Supreme Court picks have been a major topic of presidential elections for decades, but for some voters the topic seemed a bit abstract, not knowing which justice would retire from the Court at what time and therefore what would be at stake over the upcoming four-year presidential term. With the sudden passing of Scalia in February 2016, the future of the Court went from abstract theory to crystal-clear fact. Whether it was the Supreme Court’s recognizing the Second Amendment right to bear arms as an individual right or upholding Obamacare’s individual mandate as a tax, people could study a host of historic cases decided by a 5-4 split vote, look at how Scalia voted, do the math, and understand the stakes.\n\nCandidate Trump made clear that he wanted judges who would interpret federal law according to the text of the laws Congress passes, and interpret the Constitution according to the original public meaning of its words. He even published a list of potential Supreme Court picks from which he would choose new justices.\n\nPolls showed that half of voters considered judicial appointments when casting their vote for president, and that one voter in five made it their top issue.

The salary and wage component rose even more–by a full percentage point. The last time manufacturing saw quarterly wage gains that high was in 2008, when wages also rose 1.0 percent in the January through March period. Compared with a year ago, manufacturing wages were up 2.9 percent in March. That’s the biggest 12-month gain since March of 2003, when wages rose 3.2 percent.\n\nBy Barack Obama’s final year in office, manufacturing wages were rising an average of just 0.625 a quarter.\n\nVery low inflation means that unlike past gains in worker pay, these have not been eaten away by higher prices. Prices in March were up just 1.5 percent compared with year-earlier levels, which makes the real wage gain 1.4 percent. Back in March 2003, prices were up 2.5 percent. So most of the paycheck growth went to higher prices. In March of 2008, the situation was even worse: 3.1 percent inflation meant workers were actually losing ground despite growing paychecks. There’s another reason to think that the first quarter of 2019 may have been better than either 2003 or 2008. In both those periods, unemployment in the manufacturing industry was quite high, 6.8 percent in 2003 and 5 percent in 2008.

Imagine this was in something other than a leftist newspaper?” Imam Mohamad Tawhidi, an Australian Muslim peace advocate, condemned the cartoon on Twitter and said it served “an ISIS agenda.” Seth Frantzman of the Jerusalem Post shared his thoughts on the cartoon, which appeared next to a column by Thomas Friedman and said, “Shame on the NYT for this. How hard is in a time of increasing #antisemitism not to publish an anti-semitic cartoon? This is a major newspaper. Dozens of people must have seen this before it went to press. No one said anything?” In a tweet issued to his account, New York Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin called the cartoon “absolutely disgraceful.” The New York Times has since released a statement, which said an editor’s note will appear in Monday’s international edition.\n\nThe statement, which noted “anti-Semitic tropes” and was shared by The New York Times Opinion on Twitter, reads: “A political cartoon in the international print edition of The New York Times on Thursday included anti-Semitic tropes, depicting the prime minister of Israel as a guide dog with a Star of David collar leading the president of the United States, shown wearing a skullcap. The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e752aa4a272a2764ae98f4bda40aa6b0/5E5364CA/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.100.1080.1080a/s640x640/58978606_858270064518924_2335621552613738260_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwxEaN5Hz01/", "caption": "President Donald Trump @realdonaldtrump spoke to the NRA-ILA Leadership Forum @nationalrifleassociation on Friday, stressing that concealed carry can thwart heinous, high profile attacks.\n\nPresident Trump referenced the November 13, 2015, Paris attack, where armed terrorists shot and killed 130 unarmed concert goers and revelers.

Not surprisingly, the platform willing to accept something from a conservative high school senior was Breitbart. Then as now, Breitbart was willing to provide a place for otherwise unheard voices to be expressed.\n\nThe headline for that 2012 column was “Liberal Bias Starts in High School Economics Textbooks.” I pointed out that Krugman’s Economics for AP, written by Margaret Ray and David A. Anderson, and adapted from Paul Krugman and Robin Wells’ Economics (Second Edition), was being used as the textbook to teach the principles of economics to our supposedly best and brightest young people.\nIn that text, Krugman, who never met a free market he wished to remain free, dismissed the success of Ronald Reagan’s economic policies without any presentation of arguments to the contrary.  In my 2012 editorial I wrote: “Throughout the entire textbook, there are historical, factual, and statistical distortions. For example, Chapter 36 (“The modern macroeconomic consensus”) contains 16 sweeping generalizations such as: “Nearly all macroeconomists now agree… There is now a broad consensus… Today, most macroeconomists believe… Almost all macroeconomists now accept…” (pp. 355-58). None of these assertions are backed up with even a single citation. If a student were to submit an essay with such disregard for basic evidence, it would ensure a failing grade.” I enjoyed looking back at that piece and reading the brief bio line at the end that identified me as a “…high school senior who will be attending Baylor University.” It also identified me as the co-founder of SOS Liberty. I could not have imagined then that Baylor and SOS were a dream and that Turning Point USA would become my reality. Much has changed in the past seven years.... Dishonest curriculum being forced upon high school students is what motivated me to write my first op-ed piece seven years ago today.

Support of the president’s ouster hit a survey high of 49 percent in August. Support rose for the measure to 62 percent among Democrats, yet tumbled 36 percent with independents. Only 10 percent of Republicans support it. The survey comes after the Department of Justice released a redacted version of the Mueller report earlier this month, which concluded the Trump campaign did not collude or conspire with the Kremlin. Based on the special counsel’s findings, Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined President Trump did not obstruct justice. Barr offered Congressional leaders an opportunity to view certain redacted exceptions unredacted — an offer rebuffed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and fellow top House Democrats. Instead, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler opted to subpoena the full report and its underlying evidence. Barr is also slated to testify before the House Judiciary Committee next Thursday on Mueller’s findings.\n\nA Hill-HarrisX poll released this week shows a majority of respondents believe Barr’s summary last month of the Mueller report was largely accurate.

That certainly won’t be Chinese President Xi Jinping’s message to world leaders at the second Belt and Road Initiative Forum in Beijing this week, but that is the reality.\n\nFor the last two decades, China fooled the world into believing it would embrace the rules-based international order and become a responsible stakeholder. Instead, China has used its membership in the World Trade Organization as an instrument for its economic advancement aimed directly at the expense of other more developed member states. Moreover, it has tightened its one-party authoritarian rule, increased repression of domestic dissent, and escalated human rights abuses within its borders. And it is building up its military’s might—including new capabilities to menace Taiwan, Japan, and other neighbors to threaten U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific region, and to project power globally. China now is trying to fool the world again by luring foreign governments to join its Belt and Road Initiative with extravagant promises of Chinese investment for their infrastructure projects.\n\nSome countries have already learned hard lessons from Beijing’s debt-trap diplomacy. For example, Sri Lanka was forced to give a Chinese state-owned company majority control of its $1.3 billion Hambantota port for 99 years after it defaulted on a Chinese loan, and Pakistan is now seeking to drastically curb borrowing from China as it faces a mounting debt crisis.\n\nYet these and other cautionary tales aren’t deterring everyone. Last March, Italy became the first G7 nation to sign on to the Belt and Road Initiative. Alarmingly, the United Kingdom appears willing to allow some Chinese hardware into the development of their 5G network. More countries in Europe and other regions may soon follow....

As an example of American princelings, Schweizer pointed to the Chinese government’s provision of $1.5 billion in funding for Bohai Harvest RST (BHR), a private equity firm upon whose board Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, sits. “In December of 2013, Vice President Joe Biden flies to Asia for a trip, and the centerpiece for that trip is a visit to Beijing, China,” said Schweizer. “To put this into context, in 2013, the Chinese have just exerted air rights over the South Pacific, the South China Sea. They basically have said, ‘If you want to fly in this area, you have to get Chinese approval. We are claiming sovereignty over this territory.’ Highly controversial in Japan, in the Philippines, and in other countries. Joe Biden is supposed to be going there to confront the Chinese. Well, he gets widely criticized on that trip for going soft on China. So basically, no challenging them, and Japan and other countries are quite upset about this.” Elaborating, Schweizer said, “Well, I think the reason he goes soft on China is because with him on that trip, flying on Air Force Two, is his son Hunter Biden, and ten days after they return from China, Hunter Biden... gets a whopping $1.5 billion deal from the Chinese government.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/152e4fa419c4be0b9fef0cf718d64b64/5E45CB60/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/57442727_1210095762492014_1598000322822926122_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwrYEt_Hf1A/", "caption": "⬛️When will the Establishment Media demand answers from Democrat presidential candidate Joe “China Deal” Biden @joebiden ?⬛️", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7403bdd858de863cf92c7a56fb27471b/5E480CA4/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/58454175_228041484819481_2829329507130940747_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bwp730sHQPg/", "caption": "🔴EXCLUSIVE by @donaldjtrumpjr 🔴 What did the Democrats know and when did they know it?\n\nFor the last two and half years, the vicious Trump haters in the Democratic Party and the media have been bending the truth and outright lying to try and hang the Watergate hat on my father. The natural takeaway from the 448 pages of Robert Mueller’s report is that the analogy fits them a lot better. There was no collusion — none, not by anyone associated with the Trump Campaign. And, according to the report, Special Counsel Mueller appeared to know this as far back as 2017.\n\nAnd yet, for another two years Democrats such as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff continued to claim, bald-faced, that they had evidence of collusion.\n\nSo I’ll ask the question again: what did they know and when did they know it? Every indication is that anyone who was in the know knew better. Even before the Mueller probe began, the Democrats’ own intelligence experts were telling them there was no collusion. That should have given them a pretty good indication that if their real concern was Russian election interference, then digging into my father, his family, and the Americans who helped us pull off the greatest electoral upset in modern history was just a huge waste of time.\n\nIf you still have any lingering questions about the Russiagaters’ motives, they should all be answered in full by the left’s reaction to the Mueller report. The first volume of the report — you know, the one that conclusively shows there was absolutely no collusion — was met with universal disappointment from Democrats.

Rather, it expands the state’s “Guardian” program to give teachers who wish to be armed the opportunity to pursue the training and credentials necessary to do so.

Florida’s Amendment Four was approved by voters during last year’s Midterm election.\nThe heavily Soros-funded American Civil Liberties Union and Brennan Center for Justice based in New York both served as consultants in drafting Amendment Four.\n\nSoros’s Open Society Foundations donated $50 million to the ACLU. The Brennan Center has been the recipient of numerous grants from Soros’s Open Society Foundations totaling over $7,466,000 from 2000 to 2010 alone.\n\nDesmond Meade, president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, helped lead activism that put Florida’s Amendment Four on the ballot last year, including a news-making petition to restore voting rights to the released felons. His group is currently opposing efforts to require the former felons to pay their court fees prior to regaining their voting abilities. “When I looked out of the plane, I said somewhere down there’s an imaginary line that divides Florida from Georgia. And it reminds me of the days of slavery when all a slave had to do was cross an imaginary line to get to freedom,” Meade said, comparing the ex-felon registration drive to the fight against slavery. “And I said there is no way in hell in the 2000s should any American citizen have to escape another state to experience their freedom and their democracy.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7161189a7f960c189868a640eba052d7/5E4C7332/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/56614177_428529104640590_6715222983375395976_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwkVP8uHEcC/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0b315072d612b1f3ae0ebbb98459382c/5DC1F386/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/56716433_1138460146316058_5328599278170102842_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwkKiR5nL81/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e478a9cae26d8fe64337e14c10f77e74/5DC16A5B/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/57799320_2330750577197241_9177465644615196616_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwkF71wnl7s/", "caption": "Michael Avenatti has been accused of embezzling $2.5 million from a negotiated payment Miami Heat player Hassan Whiteside thought he was making to his former girlfriend, Alexis Gardner, according to prosecutors.\n\nAvenatti was supposed to be acting as Gardner’s attorney and had negotiated a three-million dollar deal with the NBA player to settle what promised to be an embarrassing lawsuit against Whiteside, the Los Angeles Times reported.

She’s getting death threats on a daily basis.\n\nWATTERS: What’s an existential threat?\n\nRIVERA:  She’s getting death threats on a daily basis. […] I’m a New Yorker.

We can give them an unlimited supply.” The president commented on the border crisis after hosting an event at the White House to promote the growth of 5G networks.\n\nTrump mocked Democrats for insisting that his administration let migrants and illegal immigrants in, rather than deporting them. “They always seem to have open arms,” Trump said. “Let’s see if they have open arms.” Trump said the “horrible old fashioned laws” made it impossible to detain illegals longer than 20 days, adding that the current asylum laws were “absolutely insane.” Trump specifically referred to the Governor of California, who welcomed more refugees and illegals.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/20ac7048331f2bfa5c97c5b553d991cc/5E5D91AB/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/56354066_2347007672186937_7566441197016253074_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwK5XFmHu5a/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/44521b63d66d2cec65c05d94023e6186/5E3F1B87/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/52624229_423893618402320_5127096652280847215_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BwKuQqGn3Zw/", "caption": "JUST IN: The U.S. Secret Service on Friday afternoon apprehended a man attempting to light his jacket on fire outside the White House, according to several reports.\n\nCNN reporter Jeremy Diamond said the unidentified man was being treated for injuries following the incident and posed no threat to President Donald Trump.

At a fundraiser for the Council on American Islamic Relations, she reduced the 9/11 terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans to “some people did something.” I have news for the freshman congresswoman from Minnesota: when 3,000 Americans are murdered by radical Islamic terrorists, it’s not “some people did something,” it’s an act of war. Omar’s minimization of that despicable attack on our country is an insult to all Americans, especially those who lost loved ones on 9/11, and offers a disturbing insight into what Omar really thinks of her adopted homeland. That such remarks came from a sitting member of the United States Congress is particularly disgraceful.\nSadly, instead of condemning her vile comments, Democrats in Congress and in the media have remained largely silent about her comments, but that’s become par for the course for a Democrat Party that now counts Omar as part of the mainstream.\nAnd now, on top of all that, and only weeks after “unequivocally” apologizing for her antisemitic tropes, Rep. Omar has set her sights on a Jewish White House adviser.\n“Stephen Miller is a white nationalist,” Omar tweeted. “The fact that he still has influence on policy and political appointments is an outrage.”\nIs my brother-in-law Jared Kushner, who is also Jewish, part of the neo-Nazi conspiracy, too?

In recent weeks, Democrats have called for abolishing the country’s constitutional voting system, allowing children to vote, and packing the Supreme Court.... Under a popular vote system, a Democrat could win by never campaigning outside the Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Boston, Washington, and Chicago metro areas. If you thought the heartland was overlooked by politicians now, just wait until the votes there don’t matter under a popular vote system.\n\nRecognizing the support they have from young people who have never filed a tax return or provided for their families, Democrats are also pushing to lower the voting age to 16. “I myself have always been for lowering the voting age to 16,” says House Majority Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “I think it’s really important to capture kids when they’re in high school…” Last month, a majority of House Democrats voted to lower the federal voting age to this threshold.... Aside from 18 being the voting age set in the constitution, this is the widely recognized age of adulthood, with the rights and responsibilities that it caries. Why stop at 16? If the voting age were lowered to 13 — the onset of the teenage years — Democrats could certainly “capture” millions more votes.

Ruptly journalist Barnaby Nerberka has been broadcasting live from the embassy since tensions escalated between WikiLeaks and the Ecuadorian government of Lenin Moreno last week, and captured the arrest on camera.

WikiLeaks was eventually vindicated, as the existence of those sealed charges was revealed in November last year. In June last year, Vice President Mike Pence pressured the Ecuadorian government on the status of Assange following demands from Senate Democrats that he do so.

Both parties will receive 35 seats (out of 120) in the next Knesset (parliament). However, Likud won by less than 1% — roughly a few thousand votes — with little left to count.\nMoreover, the bloc of right-wing and religious Jewish parties is much larger than the bloc of left-wing and Arab parties, with the right projected to win 65 seats and the left projected to win only 55. That means Netanyahu is very likely to form the next government, after consultation with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, who will meet with each of the elected parties’ leaders to ask them formally to submit their recommendation as to who should be prime minister. The Times of Israel described what it called Netanyahu’s “easy path” to an unprecedented fifth term, as Likud won more seats than it had in any election since 2003, and the most under Netanyahu’s leadership. The NYT had prematurely declared the result a “setback” for Netanyahu when exit polls showed Blue and White leading Likud by as much as four seats. One exit poll even showed a 60-60 deadlock between left and right in the 120-seat Knesset.\nThose exit polls reportedly led to jubilation at Blue and White headquarters, and solemnity at the Likud victory party.

Last year, as Breitbart News reported, Netanyahu spoke to the annual memorial service in Jerusalem for Ethiopian Jews who died on their escape from famine and war in Africa to the only country that would offer them refuge, telling the gathering: “The entire nation of Israel can learn so much from you … We are as one person, with one heart.” The remark about “warn[ing] against Arabs coming to the polls” refers to an incident in the 2015 election, when the prime minister posted a Facebook video in which he warned his supporters: “Right-wing rule is in danger. Arab voters are coming out in droves to the polls. Left-wing organizations are busing them out.” The remark happened to be true; foreign organizations and governments — including the U.S. under President Barack Obama, who wanted to see Netanyahu defeated — were interfering in the Israeli elections, hoping to turn out the 20% Arab minority.

Nielsen’s resignation as DHS secretary comes amid a surge of illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border and an expanded Catch and Release policy that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has been tasked with carrying out.\n\nDuring Nielsen’s tenure as DHS secretary, illegal immigration has increased nearly every month over the last year and a half. Simultaneously, the Trump administration has yet to construct a border wall on new land at the southern border that did not previously have barriers built by the Bush and Obama administrations. Most recently, officials with the National ICE Council accused Nielsen of “grossly” mismanaging DHS and failing to acknowledge that the agency had been operating an expanded Catch and Release policy for border crossers and illegal aliens for months.\n\nAs Breitbart News chronicled, Nielsen previously served in the Bush administration overseeing a crisis team following the destruction of New Orleans, Louisiana, by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Everyone else crash-landed below the million mark, including Erin Burnett (992K), Don Lemon (982K), Jake Tapper (971K), Wolf Blitzer (944K), and CNN’s hideous morning show New Day (561K). Things are so bad for CNN that Fox & Friends First, which airs at 4 a.m., earns more viewers than CNN’s hideous New Day (562K viewers to 561K).

It is unlikely, for example, that the unemployment rate will rise above last month’s 3.8 percent.\n\nJobless claims can be volatile on a week to week basis.

Kirk agreed with Marlow’s assessment of the importance of shining a light on intolerance of conservatives on campus, pointing out that Breitbart News has taken a leading position in reporting on the campus culture war, often covering the experiences of TPUSA’s student members. “So one example, Alex, would be our Turning Point USA president and chapter leader Peyton, whose door got fired bombed,” continued Kirk, “This is at Andrew Breitbart’s Alma mater, actually, Tulane University — and Breitbart [News] did such a beautiful job of covering this.” Kirk was referring to an incident at Tulane University in which three students were arrested for arson after setting the TPUSA chapter president’s dorm room door ablaze. “I do have to say, the UC Berkeley story in particular, Breitbart really helped keep the drumbeat going — remember, it took them a while to arrest that thug that punched Hayden Williams in the face,” added Kirk as he recalled another recent incident occurring on the campus of UC Berkeley, in which a conservative activist training TPUSA student members was punched multiple times in the face.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7cca9631cce6d028da5350d3a7ed6b2c/5E44AD64/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.132.1080.1080a/s640x640/55778917_303715660309373_9049021585496320329_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvzqYuhHBHR/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/73c82b97e098b63cbefa688815fc2cd8/5DC205CD/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/54238035_568639676970441_5456053868073564780_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvzlEilHeas/", "caption": "Former Vice President and potential 2020 Democrat presidential contender Joe Biden on Wednesday responded to fresh allegations of inappropriate touching against him from several women, pledging to be “more mindful about respecting personal space.” “Social norms are changing,” Biden wrote in a social media post with two-minute long video. “I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying.” “Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future,” he continued. “That’s my responsibility and I will meet it.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/6f6705faf2b0d1409f85c59b5fa9d887/5E5C02B3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.82.1080.1080a/s640x640/53759566_149935862708339_9038136243436979236_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvzgyLbHNO0/", "caption": "@joebiden", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/77305f61710552d792720f9d7d7bc13c/5E3F839E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/54511664_414331482692297_1266294471065379954_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvzHwnBnGR7/", "caption": "🔴The more the Left attacks @tuckercarlsontonight , the stronger he grows🔴 Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show earned more viewers last week than all of CNN’s primetime line up combined, reports the Daily Wire’s Ryan Saavedra.\n\nThis has to be a bitter pill for CNN.

The pair of complaints, which were reportedly filed as Omar campaigned for the House last year, were brought by State Rep. Steve Drazkowski (R). In his complaint to the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board, Drazkowski accused Omar of spending nearly $6,000 in campaign money on a trip to Boston and Estonia and for divorce attorney fees. “Drazkowski’s filing of the two complaints followed an earlier episode in which Omar repaid $2,500 for honoraria she received for speeches at colleges that receive state funding, a violation of ethics rules for Minnesota lawmakers,” 13 WHAM-TV reports.\n“I had observed a long pattern,” Drazkowski said in an interview with 13 WHAM-TV at his office. “Representative Omar hasn’t followed the law. She’s repeatedly trampled on the laws of the state in a variety of areas, and gotten by with it.” Omar denies misusing the funds, claiming her payment to divorce attorney Carla Kjellberg was for providing crisis management services as she ran for the Minnesota State House, according to Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nElected to Congress in November 2018, Omar has quickly established herself as one of Washington’s most divisive lawmakers. The 37-year old Somalian, who immigrated to the U.S. with her family in 1995, has sparked bipartisan blowback for a series of antisemitic outbursts in which she accused pro-Israel lawmakers of dual allegiance and suggested the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) bribes Republicans into supporting the Jewish state. The latter trope earner her rebuke from House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-NY), who demanded she apologize for the “vile antisemitic slur.”\nThe slur also prompted Democrats to introduce a resolution condemning antisemitism and other bigotry, though the watered-down measure failed to specifically condemn Omar.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/802adc209d4d0dafeba89726d806bdce/5E3F3892/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.78.1080.1080a/s640x640/55758146_275076866770079_8356971884480273425_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvwGeQtHOiB/", "caption": "BY: @charliekirk1776 of @turningpointusa —  Poor Joe Biden.

Lappos said the alleged incident occurred during a 2009 fundraiser for Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT), who she served as a congressional aide at the time.

His point was that there were legitimate protesters who came to Charlottesville to demonstrate against the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, as well as legitimate protesters who came to demand the statue’s removal, or to express opposition to the neo-Nazis. The president added, for clarity: “I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally.” He also condemned the neo-Nazis and white supremacists several times — both in that press conference itself and in a speech from the White House devoted to the subject earlier that week.\n\nCNN reported at the time that Trump’s reference to “fine people” meant those who came to protest about the statue.\n\nHowever, in February 2019, CNN’s Chris Cuomo aired a clip of neo-Nazis marching in a torchlight procession in Charlottesville (taken from a Vice/HBO documentary about the riots), then cut to the clip of Trump’s press conference in which he said there were “very fine people” on both sides. Cuomo never showed Trump’s full remarks, in which he noted that he was not referring to the neo-Nazis. Worse, Cuomo claimed Trump had failed to note the “ugliness” in Charlottesville, and added, for emphasis: “I’d like to believe that the President of the United States just had an off moment, or said it wrong, he doesn’t mean it.

Acting ICE Director Ron Vitiello confirmed to Senator Lindsey Graham that at current rates, the U.S. is on track to admit about 1.2 million illegal aliens by the end of the year. “If March numbers hold, we are on track for 1.2 million illegal immigrants coming into the country in 2019,” Graham wrote online.\n\nCenter for Immigration Studies Executive Director Mark Krikorian compared the flood of illegal immigration to the European migrant crisis, which remains ongoing, where the continent saw nearly 2.5 million illegal crossings into the Mediterranean in 2015 and 2016. “We are seeing an Angela Merkel-style disaster on the border caused by loopholes in our laws that the Democrats refuse to even consider changing,” Krikorian told Politico. As Breitbart News chronicled, President Trump’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is set to oversee the largest flow of illegal immigration into the U.S. since the Bush administration — for whom she previously worked. In 2019, illegal immigration is set to outpace every year of illegal immigration of the Obama administration.\n\nRepublican voters overwhelmingly want deportation of illegal aliens a top priority, Pew Research Center finds.

The Pew Research survey reveals Republican voters, by a majority, view illegal immigration as a burden to their quality of life that will impact future generations. Nationwide, there are roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens living in the country. As Department of Homeland Security (DHS) data has revealed, once illegal aliens resettle in the U.S., the overwhelming majority are never deported.\n\nIn terms of wage stagnation, research by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has discovered that the country’s mass illegal and legal immigration policy — where more than 1.5 million foreign nationals are admitted every year — shifts about $500 billion in wages away from working and middle class Americans toward new arrivals and economic elites. Mass immigration, whether legal or illegal, puts downward pressure on Americans’ wages, researchers have repeatedly noted.\n\nEvery one percent increase in the immigrant composition of an American workers’ occupation reduces their weekly wages by about 0.5 percent, researcher Steven Camarotta has found. This means the average native-born American worker today has their weekly wages reduced by perhaps 8.5 percent because of current legal immigration levels. Likewise, every one percent increase in the immigrant composition of low-skilled U.S. occupations reduces wages by about 0.8 percent.

Members of the Senate also joined the effort, one being Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. “Discrimination has no place in our society. I am proud to display this flag as a symbol of my support for transgender people across the country. We must stand with transgender people in all of our communities,” Sanders tweeted this week. Other Democrats who placed the gay pride flag outside their office include Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy, Washington Reps. Adam Smith and Kim Schrier, Ohio’s Tim Ryan, and Virginia Rep. Jennifer Wexton, among others.\n\nPresident Trump’s ban on transgenders in the military remains mired in the courts, but the U.S. Supreme Court recently allowed the ban to continue despite a lower court’s ruling to put a halt on the ban as lawsuits against the policy wind their way through the system.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0b5c83ecf5156afc145ea6be97e4f5b0/5E4D3A90/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.88.1080.1080a/s640x640/55883498_551378048688854_3871714589427318721_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvmh-r6nTqL/", "caption": "BY NOLTE:  Rep.

Quinnipiac found Ocasio-Crazy’s national favorability rating sits at a pathetic 23 percent; her unfavorable is 36 percent, which means she is upside down by double digits — 13 whole points.\nBut here is sweetest part of the song … only 47 percent of Democrats — Democrats, y’all — view Ocasio-Crazy favorably. Seven percent view her unfavorably and 44 percent have no idea who she is.\nAmong Independents, the self-proclaimed socialist (who grew up in Westchester — LOL) is upside-down 16 points — 20 to 36 percent.\nOcasio-CowFart is even upside down with women, 27 to 30 percent.\nFaced with this news, the freshman congresswoman went the full-black helicopter. After posting a link to her terrible, awful, very bad polling news, she tweeted, “It’s almost as though there is a directed + concerted far-right propaganda machine with a whole cable news channel, and a dark-money internet operation propped up by the Mercers et al dedicated to maligning me & stoking nat’l division[.]” What’s driving Ocasio-Crazy crazy is that this is the fourth poll this year that proves just how wildly unpopular she and her terrible ideas are.\nGallup has her upside down by ten points, 31 percent favorable to 41 percent unfavorable.

The best part was when he looked straight at me and said, “I’m proud of you,” Tlaib wrote on Instagram, sharing a photo of her posing with the former president. The Michigan Democrat, who is first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress, has quickly established herself as one of the most divisive lawmakers in Washington. Hours after being sworn in, Tlaib spoke before a reception held by the progressive MoveOn.org in which she vowed to “impeach the motherfucker,” a reference to President Trump. She has also pushed several antisemitic tropes, accusing pro-Israel lawmakers of forgetting which “country they represent.” Tlaib has a history of associating with anti-Jewish radicals, including Abbas Hamideh, an anti-Israel extremist and staunch supporter of the Hezbollah terror group, who she posed for a photo with at a swearing-in ceremony. She is also a supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, a global campaign promoting various forms of boycotts against the Jewish state. According to several reports, Obama met with Democrats to discuss how to advance legislation in an ever-polarized Congress. He also warned that bills or proposals attracting too much media attention before ample support is secured could hurt its prospects of being turned into law.\n\nOne source told the Washington Post that the former president also told the House Democrat freshman they “shouldn’t be afraid of big, bold ideas—but also need to think in the nitty-gritty about how those big, bold ideas will work and how you pay for them.” While Obama did not single out a specific policy, some inside the room believe Obama was referring to the Green New Deal, the far-left proposal to pursue 100 percent non-combustible energy by 2030.

Dan has been in and out of President Trump’s world since the beginning of his administration and going all the way back to the age of 16 when he was hand-picked to be the golf caddy for then-businessman Donald Trump.  That fortuitous moment started him on a path that has landed him front and center in the President’s efforts to get around the MSM and communicate directly with the American people.\nI have gotten to know Dan well over the past couple of years.  He is the guy who always makes himself available no matter how busy he is.  He is the guy who follows up on every commitment he makes and delivers what he promised.  He is the guy who always makes sure his activities shine the best possible light on the President and his initiatives.\nScavino was dragged into the Mueller investigation like almost everyone else around the President.  One area where he was mentioned was the Trump campaign’s alleged connection to WikiLeaks and the accessing of Clinton campaign computers.  This included the statement offered in obvious jest by then-candidate Trump when he urged the Russians to find Hillary’s thirty-thousand or so lost emails...

Many of them, you know who they are,” he said. “They’ve done so many evil things.” Trump hinted that the country had to make sure that rogue forces in the FBI and the Justice Department could not bring a similar phony case against another president in the future. “What they did, it was a false narrative, it was a terrible thing. We can never let this happen to another president again,” he said.\n\nHe also added that he supported releasing the report, but said that it was ultimately up to Attorney General William Barr.\n\nTrump said he believed that Special Counsel Robert Mueller acted honorably during the investigation of his campaign into possible collusion with Russia.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7b66798209620d7b9bdb78f41cef3852/5E41B957/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.26.1080.1080a/s640x640/53801574_159892524956983_4118861697477693199_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvcBi5tn9HE/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/61d06f8964476813c8118c7e8c2cf356/5DC10BDD/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/54512074_126244131822965_3462899999357914295_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bvb_a8NnMVb/", "caption": "◼️Never Forget the Genesis of the Big Lie◼️ Now that a summary letter of Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller‘s investigation has concluded that President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign did not collude with the Kremlin, it’s worth highlighting again how Hillary Clinton hatched a plan and personally placed blame for her election loss on Russia just “twenty-four hours of her concession speech.” The stunning revelation was reported by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, who methodically detailed in their Clinton campaign tell-all, Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton’s Doomed Campaign how Clinton helped fan the flames of “Russian collusion” by blaming her election loss on the FBI investigation into her private emails and Russian interference.\n“She wants to make sure all these narratives get spun the right way,” a longtime Clinton confidant told Allen and Parnes. The pair detailed how Hillary Clinton’s Russia-blame-game was spurred by her senior campaign staffers John Podesta and Robby Mook, less than “within twenty-four hours” after she conceded to Trump.\nFrom Shattered: “That strategy had been set within twenty-four hours of her concession speech. Mook and Podesta assembled her communications team at the Brooklyn headquarters to engineer the case that the election wasn’t entirely on the up-and-up. For a couple of hours, with Shake Shack containers littering the room, they went over the script they would pitch to the press and the public. Already, Russian hacking was the centerpiece of the argument.” The Clinton camp’s Russia propaganda strategy was two-pronged: first, they encouraged a willing and sympathetic media to cover how “Russian hacking was the major unreported story of the campaign, overshadowed by the contents of stolen e-mails and Hillary’s own private-server imbroglio,” while “hammering the media for focusing so intently on the investigation into her e-mail, which had created a cloud over her candidacy,” Allen and Parnes wrote.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a4c764705308039fec1bc73139481a9e/5E535593/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/53548192_165753067749374_7740801671892945624_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvbkyskndrA/", "caption": "🤣🤣🤣🤣 Former Barack Obama administration official Van Jones told CNN’s Don Lemon on Sunday evening that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s finding that there had been no collusion between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and the Russian government had triggered “sadness and disappointment and disorientation among progressives and Democrats.” Jones noted that Democrats had become too focused on the Mueller investigation, believing it would provide a means to remove Trump from office, while ignoring other issues. “I’ve been trying to tell folks for a long time: there’s no Santa Claus, there’s no Harry Potter with a magic wand. And I can’t tell you how many people over the years have come up to me — serious people, with their hearts broken — saying, “But when Bob Mueller comes, man, he’s gonna get Trump, and Trump’s gonna be out of there — Van, how many more days do you think Trump has left? And I said, “Maybe eight years, if we don’t start working on real issues and not just talking about Robert Mueller all the time.” “It is good that the president was not up to no good with the Russians,” Jones said. “But it’s still confusing to people — ‘Why does he kiss up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin so much? Why does he want to meet with him by himself?’. People are confused — ‘Well, if it’s not that, what is it?'” Jones could have elaborated, but did not, that voters and activists on the left had struggled to understand that Trump’s policies on Russia — the toughest of any president since the Cold War — were different than his diplomatic tone.\n\nOverall, Jones said, there was a sense of grief: “I think people are also just heartbroken that it seems like he’s going to continue to say and do stuff that we can’t do, and there’s no consequences.” In other words: progressives and Democrats had misled themselves, and each other, into believing they had not actually lost the 2016 election.

The head of China is a Maoist. They’re going through the worst crackdown since the 1960s.” Chinese pastors told King they view persecution of Christians in China as blessing through hardship: “I said, ‘Give me pastors. Bring pastors to me that have spent at least ten years in prison.’ So the group I met with — we met in secret — these guys had been in prison for ten to 25 years, and I asked them about persecution, and they said, ‘Look, this is what we think about a persecution. It’s a gift. It’s not one we would choose, but it is a gift because it keeps the church here.” “These guys weren’t afraid of the arrests,” continued King. “They weren’t afraid of the churches being bulldozed and sentences of 25 years, and with torture, the worst you can imagine. Here’s what they were afraid of — they were afraid of materialism. They were afraid of ease, and the distraction that comes with the materialism, and they said, ‘We worry that the government is not hunting us, now, they’re not imprisoning us.

vindication that is described in the obstruction of justice decision here is by Attorney General Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, not by Mueller.” “Mueller, sort of presented the evidence of obstruction of justice to the Department of Justice, as I understand this, and then it was the attorney general and the deputy attorney general who decided that based on that evidence, there wasn’t enough to prosecute,” Toobin continued. “That is a–it’s still a vindication, but it’s quite a different one from Mueller’s total vindication of the president on the issue of…collusion with Russia.”

If the bill passes, it will overturn a ban on lemonade stands instituted by the Texas Food Establishment over concerns about homemade drinks violating health codes.\nLocal police departments have historically gone after kids trying to make a quick buck by setting up temporary lemonade stands either in front of their homes or in public parks. The Denver Police stopped two young boys selling lemonade in 2018 because they did not obtain a permit to operate as a business; and in 2015, police shut down two Texas girls operating a lemonade stand because they did not have a permit.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/35a5f072be22fddf4505e0462062361f/5E610B79/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.26.1080.1080a/s640x640/54266338_185189359115292_7098158087906672208_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvXCnbinB72/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/1ea05eb75cd60640018487c454f6f60e/5DC1FD0E/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/54510851_297514284251131_4505741493342402947_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvW6_YsnNAC/", "caption": "🔴 Now it's time to launch an investigation into Hillary Clinton, Uranium One, and the phony so-called dossier!🔴", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dd2172998f41335a8c14e9d1bb5a2395/5E44EC1D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.77.1080.1080a/s640x640/54731899_1247179682095852_6485156065493391792_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvWn8hpHFWv/", "caption": "🤣Hollywood’s hopes and dreams come crashing down🤣 Hollywood celebrities spent nearly two years incessantly fantasizing about special counsel Robert Mueller indicting President Donald Trump over so-called Russian collusion during the 2016 presidential election.

He understood what’s happening in our universities.” “But one thing that [Andrew Breitbart] really warned us about is beyond the cancerous ideology,” added Kirk, “is the fact that if students can’t talk, if students can’t have the other opinions be expressed, then we have even greater problems than bad ideas.” The Turning Point USA founder also noted that some critics are saying “this is a government takeover,” which Kirk reacted to by stating that it is actually the opposite of one: “We’re talking about less funding potentially going to colleges,” said Kirk, “That would be a potential government withdrawal — essentially, it’s putting forth standards.” “These universities are so brazen,” added Kirk, “They believe there are no consequences for them, whatsoever.

His father meets with Chinese officials, he’s very soft on Beijing. The most important thing that happens happens 10 days after they return.

Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Blackstone, nobody had this deal.” He continued, “[I]t’s very, very clear and that’s the first of a series of deals that Hunter Biden strikes with the Chinese government, so there’s no question, when you chart what Joe Biden is doing with China, the meetings he’s having, and the deals that his sign is procuring at the same time, that they are buying off Biden through his son.

This is an important day for me, personally as this has been the primary mission of Turning Point USA @turningpointusa .\nNot too many opinion people are weighing in on this yet. It is kind of a difficult topic for them. Those in the mainstream media, an ideologically homogeneous group, need to thread the needle of wanting to appear to be in favor of free speech while arguing that the president requiring free speech is somehow dangerous. That isn’t easy and that is why they have been mostly silent.\nDon’t worry. They will figure it out soon and they will find a way to come after the president.\nAn exception to the silence of analysts is an opinion piece published by CNN on March 18. In it, Suzanne Nossel and Jonathan Friedman of PEN America share their concerns about the upcoming order. The piece is not unreasonable in its tone, and it does fairly point out examples of how team left university officials and students are stifling free speech on campus.\nBut the writers do make one critical mistake, and it is the same one that is used dismissively by everyone from politicians, to university administrators, to media commentators... The shutting down of free speech on campus is a systemic and institutionalized process that is controlled and managed by what we ironically label as “liberals.” Burn an American flag on campus or stand on a bench and decry the Constitution as racist and you will be allowed to speak. Wear an American flag on your shirt or hand out copies of the Constitution and you will be accused of triggering and sent off to the campus equivalent of the broom closet, called “Free Speech Zones,” in order to continue to express your thoughts.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/b11d97940c6d73cea9f20b1cf3ffcd7f/5E497E1F/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.86.1080.1080a/s640x640/53233652_402263683895784_1083289807154491205_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvR5Y_9nWyw/", "caption": "Empire’s ratings suffered series-lows on Wednesday as fallout from actor Jussie Smollett being indicted for filing a false police report continues to plague the Fox drama.\n\nAccording to TheWrap, Empire garnered 4 million total viewers with a 1.1 demo rating/6 share.

When we look at homelessness, we look at our continual care programs, we’re talking about over $2 billion, a quarter of which is directed towards people with substance abuse.” Carson described the addictive nature of opioids. “One of the things that people don’t realize is it’s very, very easy to get hooked on these drugs,” he said. “They’ve been overused, particularly  for pain. They’re not all that effective for pain, to be honest with you. If you take somebody who’s having a lot of pain, you give him an opioid, and then you say, ‘How’s your pain?’ They’ll say, ‘It’s still there, but I don’t care.’ That’s what it does. It makes you not care about it. It doesn’t necessarily get rid of the pain.” “It gets rid of emotional pain, too, ” added Carson. “A lot of people have that. They’re discouraged. They have all kinds of problems going on, and to be able to escape that feeling for just a few hours, it becomes irresistible, and once they experience it, it’s all they think about. That’s why you have this epidemic going on. Now, you couple that with the fact that we’re not doing an adequate job of keeping these drugs out, not only at the border but things that are coming through the mail from China and places like that, and it becomes overwhelming.” Opioid abuse diminishes America’s productivity, stated Carson. “The price has gone down to the point where a lot of people can afford it who could not afford it before,” he remarked. “So it’s a vast, vast problem.

Overall food stamp participation had consistently declined since 2013, when the Obama administration was in power and enrollment in the program reached its highest levels in American history.\n\nAfter 2013, SNAP enrollment plummeted once state legislatures passed laws requiring food stamp recipients to work, attend school, volunteer, or participate in job training for a set number of hours per week to receive benefits.\n\nFood stamp enrollment dropped even further under President Trump’s administration @realdonaldtrump partly because of the administration’s efforts to reform welfare programs like SNAP at federal and state levels of government and an improving economy spurred by Trump’s tax reform package.\n\nAccording to the latest USDA data, 4.2 million Americans have dropped off of the food stamp rolls during Trump’s presidency.\n\nPresident Trump also signaled that he is looking to limit dependency on welfare programs like food stamps even further.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/cef91868cd595831cf3d41ca3aae21b8/5E4E3011/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.27.1080.1080a/s640x640/53183078_142559260124742_248878555126257895_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvOq8w0HHGF/", "caption": "Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry @agjefflandry told Breitbart News that attorneys general across America — both Democrat and Republican — are considering “all actions,” including the use of existing antitrust law, to curb the growing power held by technology firms such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter. \nLandry offered his remarks in a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow @marlownews. “We have seen a tremendous amount of consolidation in regard to social platforms and the tech industry over the last decade, and the result of that has become a handful of companies that have amassed a tremendous amount of data and power over the U.S. and world economy,” said Landry.

The budget, which will spend $4.7 trillion on mandatory and discretionary programs, would leave just enough money to wind down operations of the CPB and NEA. “[P]rivate fundraising has proven durable, negating the need for continued Federal subsidies,” the budget reads. “Services such as PBS and NPR, which receive funding from CPB, could make up the shortfall by increasing revenues from corporate sponsors, foundations, and members. In addition, alternatives to PBS and NPR programming have grown substantially since CPB was first established in 1967, greatly reducing the need for publicly funded programming options.” In a statement, PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger criticized the proposal to slash funding, noting Americans have named PBS among the most publically trusted “known institutions” for the past 16 years. “PBS and our 350 member stations across the country have earned bipartisan Congressional support over the years due to the high value the American people place on the services we provide their communities,” said Kerger. “For a modest investment of about $1.35 per citizen per year, public television provides school readiness for children, support for teachers and caregivers, public safety communications and lifelong learning through high-quality content.” Despite public broadcast’s apparent bias against conservatives, a Republican-controlled Congress has funded CPB in 2017 and 2018.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c875d82adf4d5e1039befd034a9612bd/5E555B5B/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.27.1080.1080a/s640x640/53117300_793007741073127_7908175956147118522_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvKgmbyHY2p/", "caption": "🔶 @donaldjtrumpjr goes on offense against Big Tech’s anti-conservative bias!🔷 Donald Trump Jr. warned in an article for the Hill, Sunday, that Big Tech companies could soon construct a communist-style social credit system if “left unchecked.” In the article, titled “Conservatives face a tough fight as Big Tech’s censorship expands,” Trump Jr. claimed that the “right to freely engage in public discourse through speech is under sustained attack, necessitating a vigorous defense against the major social media and internet platforms.” Listing Facebook and Twitter’s use of shadowbans, YouTube’s demonetization, and Instagram’s censorship, Trump Jr. declared, “If it can happen to me, the son of the president, with millions of followers on social media, just think about how bad it must be for conservatives with smaller followings and those who don’t have the soapbox or media reach to push back when they’re being targeted?” “Silicon Valley lobbyists have splashed millions of dollars all over the Washington swamp to play on conservatives’ innate faith in the free-market system and respect for private property,” he continued. “Even as Big Tech companies work to exclude us from the town square of the 21st century, they’ve been able to rely on misguided conservatives to carry water for them with irrelevant pedantry about whether the First Amendment applies in cases of social media censorship.” Trump Jr. then proclaimed, “It’s high time other conservative politicians started heeding [Sen.

Fox News aired a repeat episode of its documentary series Scandalous on Saturday instead of Justice with Judge Jeanine. When asked why Pirro would not appear on air, a Fox News spokesperson told Deadline it would not comment on “internal scheduling matters.” Pirro was met with criticism after appearing to suggest on her program earlier March that Omar wears a hijab in defiance of the Constitution. “Think about this: She’s not getting this anti-Israel sentiment doctrine from the Democrat Party. So if it’s not rooted in the party, where is she getting it from?” Pirro said in her opening segment. “Think about it. Omar wears a hijab, which according to the Quran 33:59, tells women to cover so they won’t get molested. Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?” Pirro’s remarks came in response to the freshman congresswoman’s most recent antisemitic outburst, in which she suggested pro-Israel organizations coerce lawmakers into pledging allegiance to a foreign country.\n\nIn a statement, Fox News condemned the host’s remarks, saying: “We strongly condemn Jeanine Pirro’s comments about Rep.

Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) that would have lowered the age for voting to 16 in federal elections. The vote was 305-126 against the idea.\n\nHowever, H.R. 1 allows states to begin registering 16-year-olds to vote when they reach the legal age of 18. As Roll Call noted: “Republicans have attacked the provision as adding new risks of voting fraud in case the underage crowd tried to vote prematurely. But Democratic supporters argue it’s a convenient way to sign up future voters.” The voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 by the 26th Amendment in 1971, during the Vietnam War, when the military draft became controversial and soldiers were being sent to fight (and die) before they could vote.\n\nChildren can vote in primary elections at the age of 17 in twenty-three states and the District of Columbia — usually if they will turn 18 by the time of the general election in November of a given election year. Voters in Pelosi’s home city of San Francisco defeated a referendum in 2016 to lower the local voting age to 16. Across the San Francisco Bay, in Berkeley, 16-year-olds can vote in elections for the local public school board.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which often sides with Democrats, has also criticized H.R. 1 for some of its restrictions on political speech, writing to Congress that the legislation could “unconstitutionally burden the speech and associational rights of many public interest organizations and American citizens” and “chill speech essential to our public discourse.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/736dccac00c36b63ad3e92bdc4918f87/5E454CA1/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.92.1080.1080a/s640x640/53241802_159775945020500_7170499663258018056_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BvA53uQH1hz/", "caption": "Fox News Channel legal analyst Gregg Jarrett @thegreggjarrett , author of The Russia Hoax: The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump, told Breitbart News that political and partisan corruption at the Department of Justice and FBI prove that “Americans should be afraid of their government,” offering his comments in a Wednesday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.\n\nThe narrative of “collusion” between President Donald Trump and the Russian state was manufactured by “the swamp” in order to protect the powers of its people, said Jarrett. “The swamp needs to be drained,” Jarrett declared. “By the way, that was the motivation behind this collusion hoax. The swamp, which had been in control the last eight years under the Obama administration, viewed Trump as a threat. He threatened to drain the swamp and the swamp didn’t want to be drained. There’s nothing in Washington that will motivate you more than the threat of losing power, and that’s why they cleared Hillary Clinton in this scheme and sought to frame Donald Trump.” Jarrett continued: “I always hesitate to use what’s become a pejorative term: the deep state, but frankly, I can think of no better alternative. You’re right. Many of these people are unelected officials, but they have tremendous power. Power in Washington is like crack cocaine. It’s highly addictive.

But they’re still slightly dangerous.” Trump’s comments on Never Trumpers in the Breitbart News exclusive interview went further than a line he first rolled out in his speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union (ACU) a little over a week ago, where the president spoke for a record two-plus hours.\n“Everyone in this great country, right now, because of our great new economy, is doing well — except, of course, for the Never Trumpers,” Trump said in the CPAC speech. “But they are on mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Mouth to mouth. Mouth to mouth. They’re hanging in. A couple of them. I mean, these guys have gotten me wrong. Not only Never Trumpers. You have Never Trumpers; you have certain hardline. They’re basically dishonest people — because, look, let’s face it: Whether you like me or not — if my name is Smith instead of Trump, and if you told him I put in over 100 federal judges — it’ll soon be 145 federal judges and two Supreme Court judges. (Applause.) And 17 appellate division judges.”\nThen Trump slammed Washington Post columnist and NBC News contributor George Will—who left the Republican Party over Trump in 2016—as “almost deranged” and a “poor bastard.” He said Will was upset that he skipped a speech he gave years ago at Mar-A-Lago, Trump’s resort in  Palm Beach. “From the day I announced. George Will is almost deranged,” Trump said. “This poor bastard, I almost feel sorry for him. He was at Mar-A-Lago about 12 years ago. He made a speech. And I didn’t want to go, because I didn’t like falling asleep during something—I didn’t want to do.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/26145253acad192fe522a2825ebce05c/5E56343E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/53630756_335796300391717_3863010479939201513_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bu7E3hvBW_J/", "caption": "Television lawyer Michael Avenatti announced Tuesday that he will no longer represent pornographic actress Stormy Daniels. “On February 19, we informed Stormy Daniels in writing that we were terminating our legal representation of her for various reasons that we cannot disclose publicly due to attorney-client privilege,” Avenatti said in a statement shared to Twitter. “This was not a decision we made lightly and it came only after lengthy discussion, thought and deliberation, as well as consultation with other professionals,” he added. “We wish Stormy all the best.” In a separate statement, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she has hired a new attorney and requested he review all her legal matters. “I have retained Clark Brewster as my personal lawyer and have asked him and his firm to review all legal matters involving me.

The report found that 63 percent of non-citizen households end up on welfare, whereas just 35 percent of native-born American households end up on welfare—a major disparity. The report also shows that in non-citizen households with children, welfare usage skyrockets to 79.6 percent.\n\nTrump added that while it is his belief that some industries need more workers brought in in various capacities, the Democrats and the left are pushing to bring anyone and everyone into the country regardless of the consequences. “They’ll take anybody into this country and we’re not allowing it, but because of the success of the country economically, some people say—I blame myself, but that’s a good blame not a bad blame—but because of the country’s success and you need workers here,” Trump said. “You do need workers.

We should be excited by that.

Ocasio-Cortez then mused that with adequate policies in place, introducing more robots into the workforce could allow society more time to dabble in art and science, and actually increase the pace of innovation, freeing up “more time enjoying the world we live in.” “Not all creativity needs to be bonded by wage,” she said to loud applause.\n\nAs Ocasio-Cortez eluded to in her remarks, the vast majority of Americans are opposed to robots replacing them in certain work settings.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a45158cfeb287c83a0ce47091c0c5556/5E43E882/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.22.1080.1080a/s640x640/52300579_103876074059869_4669058373185044949_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuzxtyTHtB-/", "caption": "In a clip of an interview set to air on Sunday’s 10 p.m. ET broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Life, Liberty & Levin,” L.

Jason Frank, an attorney and former partner in the firm, accused Avenatti of attempting to shield legal fees from creditors amid the company’s bankruptcy proceedings. “Who cares? Old firm that we have not operated under for a very long time,” Avenatti said of the bankruptcy filing to the Times. “We want to ensure the proper distribution of assets to creditors — it means nothing to our current law practice. Onward and upward.” The filing puts Avenatti’s planned testimony on hold. An attorney for Frank said in a statement that Avenatti’s testimony would have “exposed” the television lawyer’s “financial shenanigans.” “That Mr. Avenatti would try something so desperate speaks volumes about how bad the evidence is against him,” said attorney Eric George.\n\nIn May 2018, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Catherine Bauer ordered the law firm to pay Frank $10 million. Under a bankruptcy settlement, court documents show Avenatti agreed to pay the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $2.4 million in unpaid taxes, fines, and interest.\n\nThe development comes after Avenatti caught a legal break in connection to his November 2018 domestic violence arrest.

And here they are again showing hostility against me and my patrons.” In a press release Tuesday, the state office announced that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission will voluntarily drop its case against Phillips and, in return, Phillips will end his federal lawsuit against the state.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/f27ae6bf62205a3b2c92b19f05d64da2/5E5D2AF8/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.83.1080.1080a/s640x640/52345716_405718133308527_195199735113779427_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bus8yZGHUXe/", "caption": "One month after claiming there is “no emergency” at the border, the far-left New York Times now concedes the border is at a “breaking point.” In real time, as President Trump gave his State of the Union speech last month, the Times branded the president a liar over his claim that there is an “urgent national crisis” at our border. “This is false,” the Times told its readers, using a non sequitur about individuals attempting to cross the border, while admitting — at the bottom of the fact check —  that a “record number of families have tried to cross the border in recent months.”\nAt the time, this phony fact check was widely ridiculed for its absurd attempt to hide the fact that a “record number of families” stressing the resources of our southern border does not somehow constitute a legitimate crisis, and now, almost exactly a month later, this very same Times is reporting our border is at a “breaking point.” “The number of migrant families crossing the southwest border has once again broken records, with unauthorized entries nearly doubling what they were a year ago, suggesting that the Trump administration’s aggressive policies have not discouraged new migration to the United States,” the Times reports. “More than 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February, an 11-year high and a strong sign that stepped-up prosecutions, new controls on asylum and harsher detention policies have not reversed what remains a powerful lure for thousands of families fleeing violence and poverty.” What the corrupt establishment media are doing here is pretty obvious…\n\nWhen Trump accurately informs the public about a “crisis” along our southern border, the media brand him a liar, which gives Democrats the cover they desire to not give Trump the resources he needs to contain the crisis.\n\nThen, as the crisis worsens, the Times gleefully reports on how out of control everything is, how Trump is not able to stop of the flow of illegal immigration.\n\nBasically, the media use propaganda to stop Trump from getting the resources he needs — so that they can then turn around and blame him for the problem.\n\nThis is all about 2020.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/67658c65e8afda591acc575b01c69b7c/5E552003/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/52997216_2585431398195140_7237147399362133731_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BusXImvHZYm/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/38a1d9e4706d7c8a6a0554e3adabed1d/5DC19179/t51.2885-15/e15/s640x640/52147160_159016321761921_708439622077617746_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BusT_dNngBD/", "caption": "Illegal immigration this year is on pace to more than triple the levels of just two years ago, new projections reveal.\n\nIn the month of February, there were more than 76,000 illegal border crossings and inadmissible foreign nationals, the most in this month in 12 years — a record for President Trump’s administration.\n\nPrinceton Policy Advisor Steven Kopits now projects that illegal border crossings for this calendar year will be more than three times what they were in 2017 and nearly double last year’s total crossings. The projection predicts there will be more than 840,000 illegal border crossings this year, though Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen predicts about 900,000 crossings. Should illegal immigration reach this level, as Kopits projects, it would mean that border crossings in Trump’s third year in office outpace every single year of illegal immigration under former President Obama. “Crossings are now clearly at crisis levels, and the pressure will be on Democrats in Congress to tighten asylum laws if they intend to hold the House in 2020,” Kopits notes. “I would note that migrants are also certainly aware of this, and therefore apprehension numbers could rise substantially heading into the summer months as migrants rush to cross the border before new legislation can be prepared.” While Nielsen receives praise from her close allies in the Washington, D.C. beltway and political establishment, her tenure has been marked with overseeing the largest illegal immigration surge not seen since former President George W. Bush. During Obama, border apprehensions at the southern border floated between more than 700,000 in Fiscal Year 2008 and dipped as low as about 327,000 apprehensions in Fiscal Year 2011. Since Fiscal Year 2017, when illegal immigration dropped to about 303,000 apprehensions, border crossings have continuously increased.\n\nThe vast majority of voters say a border wall would be effective in stopping illegal immigration, though that has not equated to progress on constructing new barriers at the border.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5276221bfb3e9b1a9e17723f50450b96/5E5A8243/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.28.1080.1080a/s640x640/53552453_268233137438257_328718596583669045_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BusFhI2HH51/", "caption": "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that American businesses needed more immigration to help grow their businesses in a revitalized economy. “Well, we’re going going to have a lot of people coming into the country, we want a lot of people coming in and we need it, it’s not a question of do we want it,” the president said, in response to a question from reporters at the end of a White House meeting of his American Workforce Policy Advisory Board.\n\nTrump told the CEOs that legal immigration was important for American companies to grow in a competitive business environment. “We’re going to let a lot of people come in because we need workers.

With Apple CEO Tim Cook sitting next to him at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he not only wanted more legal immigration but that companies needed an expansion of new arrivals to grow their business. “We’re going to have a lot of people coming into the country. We want a lot of people coming in. And we need it,” Trump said: “It’s not a question of do we want [more immigration], these folks are going to have to sort of not expand too much. And if we tell them … these are very ambitious people around this table. They don’t like the concept of not expanding. We want to have the companies grow and the only way they’re going to grow is if we give them the workers and the only way we’re going to have the workers is to do exactly what we’re doing.” The comments are a direct rebuttal of the president’s commitments in 2015, 2016, and 2017, where he vowed to reduce overall legal immigration levels to boost the wages of U.S. workers and reduce the displacement of America’s working and middle class.\n\nIn 2017, for instance, Trump touted Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Sen. David Perdue’s (R-GA) RAISE Act legislation, which would have cut legal immigration down to about 500,000 arrivals a year rather than the current admission of more than one million legal immigrants annually who compete against working-class Americans for jobs. “We need an immigration policy that’s going to be great for our corporations and our great companies … we need workers to come in but they’ve got to come in legally and they’ve got to come in through merit,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s shift in legal immigration views has coincided with the White House giving access to a myriad of globalist business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the George W.

He was, in many ways, a pioneer of the movement and the argument that we could go behind the back of mainstream media and use social media to reach out audiences.” He also called on lawmakers to “redefine” social media giants such as Facebook as publishers to help solve the issue. “So we should not only pay tribute to him, but also his warning,” he continued. “He predicted that censorship would be used on social media to stifle debate.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of the hearing was that some of the court’s liberal justices appeared sympathetic to the defenders of the cross. Justice Elena Kagan noted that the cross became a particular symbol associated with those killed in World War I. Justice Stephen Breyer asked about the importance of historical context to this case, indicating that older crosses could be permissible but erecting new religious symbols would not. “History matters,” Breyer said. “So what about saying past is past, if you go back 93 years, but no more.” Conservatives argued that the court should rethink its approach to religious symbols on public property, arguing that earlier decisions had created a confusing mess of precedent that invited endless litigation and was not well-grounded in the constitution.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/ef5db6121b5bb2f5f538092522495aaf/5E58893D/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.23.1080.1080a/s640x640/51973338_348369002555053_1496596953103053117_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuZJPdhH4ha/", "caption": "🔵Democrat Presidential Candidate Kamala Harris: We Need Slave Reparations to ‘Heal’ African-American ‘Trauma’🔵 Sen.

We can discuss what that is, but look, we’re looking at more than 200 years of slavery. We’re looking at almost a hundred years of Jim Crow. We’re looking at legalized segregation and, in fact, segregation on so many levels that exists today, based on race. And there has not been any kind of intervention done understanding the harm and the damage that occurred to correct course, and so we are seeing the effects of all of those years play out still today.\n\nTHE ROOT: And as president, you would be willing to lead a conversation about what reparations for black people would look like?  KAMALA HARRIS: Yeah, including things like what we should be doing to take very seriously undiagnosed and untreated trauma. Take that very seriously, and what kind of resources are we going to put in that?

Gordon, a Republican, has opposed proposals expanding Medicaid, Wyoming News reported.\n\nSome advocacy groups said they are concerned about provisions within the bill that would prohibit residents who fail to meet the work requirements from receiving Medicaid benefits for six months. State lawmakers across the country are proposing legislation requiring residents to work a designated amount of time to receive Medicaid after the Trump administration announced in 2018 that states would be allowed to design programs enforcing work requirements to receive Medicaid benefits.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/27f843e966d6aea2acce65bba2b79236/5E5C43A9/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.81.1080.1080a/s640x640/51870119_2284468738504617_5119820523859425679_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuP3xjjnWP6/", "caption": "Dr. Alveda King @alvedaking , niece of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., recalled Margaret Sanger’s — founder of Planned Parenthood — racist and eugenicist politics in a Friday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour and special guest host Rick Manning.\n\nManning and Mansour asked King to address the Trump administration’s Friday issuance of a rule regarding federal taxpayer funding of family planning. The new rule, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), could block about $60 million of federal government funding for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. “I was absolutely delighted, because now the regulations are being addressed and we are really seeing clearly where some of the money that Planned Parenthood gets from our tax dollars comes from,” remarked King.  King noted, “[Planned Parenthood] gets over half a billion dollars a year, and several million dollars a day in tax dollars. Some of that money does come out of Title X. So you have several million women who are served by organizations that are funded through Title X, Planned Parenthood getting a lion’s share of that.”\nKing said, “Abortion takes the life of a human being, and it is proven that that is a human being; a human by-product. Science proves it, philosophy agrees, and certainly religion has been saying that a long time.” King said, “[Margaret Sanger] thought about the unfit, that included Negroes, as we were called at the time. The unfit, those who maybe had physical disability or some mental disability, or things like that. She wanted to erase all of that out of the human population, and her plan was — first, before abortion became legal — to have birth control measures, and the negro project, tying women’s tubes and giving men vasectomies; free tubal ligations and free vasectomies in the negro community.” King added, “People just don’t know [Margaret Sanger] was doing all that. She was also an adviser to the Ku Klux Klan.

The filmmakers had hoped for a PG-13 rating.\nThe film tells the true-life story of former Planned Parenthood clinic director Abby Johnson @prolifeabbyjohnson , who left the abortion giant in 2009 to become a pro-life activist.\nMike Lindell @michaeljlindell , founder and CEO of My Pillow, invested $1 million to the movie’s production. “I’m pro-life and I’m happy to do it,” Lindell told the Hollywood Reporter. The MPAA told Konzelman and Solomon to either cut the abortion scenes or edit them. “The blood is in no way gratuitous,” Konzelman told me. “For us to not include blood in these critical scenes would be to severely cheapen this true story.” “We have three scenes in the film which directly address abortion, and the MPAA objected to all three,” Solomon said. “They specifically made mention of objection to grainy, black and white sonogram images that were part of one of the scenes. It was clear that any meaningful treatment of the issue was going to be objectionable.” An MPAA spokesperson said that the film’s distributor, Pure Flix didn’t respond to the organization’s appeals process in a timely manner. Pure Flix @pureflix president Michael Scott fired back saying, “This story needs to be told and the message needed to be delivered.”", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/878f98062e5f1148eefeb7dcf0bd1c32/5E4FAC49/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.134.1080.1080a/s640x640/52862112_121378668932109_3802038331960667996_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuPTBsln5fg/", "caption": "Nebraska State Sen. Ernie Chambers (I-Omaha) referred to the American flag as “a rag” and compared it to a swastika during a Tuesday speech on the floor of the state legislative chamber.\nChambers made the comments during a floor speech where he was criticizing a bill, LB 399, which would update civics requirements in the state’s schools to improve student literacy “in civics, history, economics, financial literacy, and geography.”\n“I don’t come here for this rag every day, and it’s a rag. That’s all it is to me,” Chambers said, referring to the American flag. “When you show a way to persuade Jews to sanctify and worship the swastika, when you show me that I’ll come up here and stand while you all hypocritically pretend that rag is something that it definitely is not.” Several lawmakers then criticized the 81-year-old state senator for his comments.\nChambers’ colleague, State Sen. Tom Brewer, who is also a military veteran, responded that “it’s hard” to refer to the American flag “as a rag” given how those who serve our country sacrifice a lot to respect the flag.\n“I think I speak for most of us that have worn the uniform, it rips our heart out to hear someone say that they refer to the flag as a rag,” Brewer said. “Because for those of us that have brought home those that we’ve lost, it’s hard to ever refer to the flag as a rag because you have to fold it and you have to get it to the parents, and that’s awful hard to do.”\nState Sen. Julie Slama, who sponsored the civics bill, also called Chambers out for “degrading” a revered symbol representing those who “sacrifice for our nation.”\n“Sen. Chambers’ comments not only degrade a symbol of ultimate sacrifice for our nation, but they also minimize the horrors and millions of lives lost in the Holocaust,” Slama said.\nChambers has a history of making inflammatory comments during his time in the Nebraska legislature. The Omaha World-Herald reported that, in a 2015 legislative hearing on concealed carry, Chambers put members of law enforcement on the same level as members of the Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group. “My ISIS is the police,” he said.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e331aea1c60a48d9cb315c55cdd50d2b/5E3E1C2E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.78.1080.1080a/s640x640/52655747_136782947364540_5808224130779529524_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuPSN5PHhsQ/", "caption": "🔵Gee, ya think?🔵 Sen.
