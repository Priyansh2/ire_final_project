The rapper and songwriter reflected on the controversial song in a recent interview with GQ for the magazine’s November issue centered on masculinity. Williams said he had his feminist awakening after “Blurred Lines,” which was highly criticized as encouraging rape culture with song lyrics like, “I know you want it.” At first, Williams said, he didn’t understand the criticism. But now, six years since the song debuted, Williams said he’s “embarrassed” to have been part of the song. \"I realized that there are men who use that same language when taking advantage of a woman, and it doesn’t matter that that’s not my behavior,” he added. “It just matters how it affects women.” // 📷: Getty Images", "key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3s3kr3nkm9/", "comments": [{"comment": "❤️", "author": "missjungleboogie"}, {"comment": "@patrickvanderoer 🙌🏻", "author": "emmys.everyday"}, {"comment": "About time", "author": "dvyshrr"}, {"comment": "I love the song, very entertaining", "author": "ayisha_chique"}, {"comment": "@brookiecookiee__ we love to see the growth", "author": "jesslaudie"}, {"comment": "You are a wonderful human xo thank you", "author": "sarahrobinpine"}, {"comment": "So does this mean he’s giving up all the millions of dollars he made from it?

The all-volunteer, nonprofit rescue organization responded to a report that Floyd and his unidentified owner needed help. Floyd, his owner and other human members of the family had hiked up the mountain but took a wrong turn on the way back, Kenney said, adding that it’s a common mistake on this particular trail. The group ended up heading down a “really steep” descent that Kenney described as a “nightmare.” It was when the family turned and attempted to go back to where they had made the wrong turn that the dog plopped down and refused to budge. While Floyd at this point was suffering from some cuts on his paws, Kenney said exhaustion was the primary reason the mastiff decided that for him, the hike was over. Luckily, Floyd took pretty well to being rescued. “He was just chill,” Kenney said. “He knew he was getting carried out. He just laid there and enjoyed the ride.” // Head to the link in bio for the full story. // 📷: Shawn Kenney/Salt Lake County Sheriff's Search And Rescue", "key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3vXNyNDzXE/", "comments": [{"comment": "Stupid owner to do this to the poor dog.

According to 10 studies included in the review, dog ownership was associated with a 24% reduction in risk of death compared to non-ownership, with six studies showing “significant reduction in the risk of death.” In one instance, simply petting a dog was found to have the same effect on blood pressure as medication.

Effective in January 2023, it prohibits the sale and manufacture of new fur products. The ban will not apply to used fur products, fur products used for religious purposes, or for traditional tribal, cultural or spiritual purposes by members of Native American tribes. The law defines “fur” as “animal skin or part thereof with hair, fleece, or fur fibers attached thereto, either in its raw or processed state,” but it has several carveouts for products that will remain legal, including leather and sheepskin. Democratic Assemblymember Laura Friedman introduced the bill in December 2018. Friedman cited California as “a world leader in animal welfare,” adding, “we will not continue to be complicit in unnecessary cruelty towards animals solely for the sake of fur.” // Read more in the link in bio. // 📷: Getty Images", "key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3pZjsjH6pt/", "comments": [{"comment": "👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏", "author": "clara.wilson.313"}, {"comment": "It’s to damn hot to wear fur in California 😂😂... that won’t fly in Michigan 👌🏾", "author": "high_as_kooda_brown"}, {"comment": "Hell yeah!

Christine Moutier of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention notes that when it comes to other areas of health, “there are really basic things most people just know, like if we exercise, we feel good or if we eat terrible the day before, we’re going to feel crappy the next day. I think that those same basic principles do apply to mental health, but that hasn’t become infused into our society yet.” This full understanding requires effort: It also takes good parenting, especially since research shows mental health issues can appear in people as young as toddlers or preschoolers. It depends on proper health care and better access to treatment, particularly in rural areas of the U.S. It means correcting ― or even just noticing ― if people use mental health-based language in a derogatory way. All of this builds into a new compassion for mental illnesses, which data shows are still viewed as less than.

Kamala Harris announced a plan that would guarantee workers up to six months of paid family and medical leave, the most generous such policy proposal in the Democratic presidential field. The proposal is more aspirational than practical, as six months of leave exceeds anything currently under consideration or on offer in the U.S. ― the only developed country that doesn’t guarantee new mothers paid time off. By calling attention to the issue, though, Harris could help bring paid leave to prominence on the 2020 agenda, from which it’s been largely absent. “Guaranteeing six months of paid leave will bring us closer to economic justice for workers and ensures newborn children or children who are sick can get the care they need from a parent without thrusting the family into upheaval,” Harris said in a statement. // Read more in the link in bio. // 📷: Getty Images", "key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3YAC8HlW6B/", "comments": [{"comment": "She still bumpin her gums🤦🏻‍♀️", "author": "kingnbear6"}, {"comment": "6 MONTHS, WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR THAT? 6 MONTHS IS AUTOMATIC TERMINATION, PERIOD", "author": "hayeug2765"}, {"comment": "IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF 6 MONTHS THAN STAY THE HELL HOME", "author": "hayeug2765"}, {"comment": "Who is gonna pay for that????😱", "author": "bekkcruz"}, {"comment": "That's awesome for the young mothers to be.
