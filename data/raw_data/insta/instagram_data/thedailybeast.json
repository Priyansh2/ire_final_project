Born in Huntington, New York (on Long Island), Whitman‚Äôs early career consisted of covering New York politics and working class affairs for local newspapers, as well as writing opera reviews, working as a teacher, and dabbling in real estate. As he took notes of his encounters with people, he began phrasing his words into rhyme and meter, eventually becoming one of the most famous collections of poems, ‚ÄúLeaves of Grass.‚Äù He observed, \"Bring all the art and science of the world and baffle and humble it with one spear of grass.\" Without a publisher interested in his book in 1855, Whitman funded the first edition of his book of verse himself. In 1865 Whitman was dismissed from his clerk job at the Department of the Interior in Washington because a colleague thought ‚ÄúLeaves of Grass‚Äù was indecent. In his lifetime, the book went through nine editions, and is now considered a classic by literati and leaders alike. Perhaps the most well-known of his poems is \"O Captain! My Captain!\", written after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865, made more famous by the movie \"Dead Poets Society\".\nPhoto illustration by @BrigetteSupernova for The Daily Beast #WaltWhitman #UShistory #literature #todayinhistory #onthisdayinhistory #LeavesOfGrass #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/af762b0a174dc9c392495e5244979c02/5E5BDDA7/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/13329096_602231963277464_344775959_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BGDdsc7HGHR/", "caption": "The original ‚ÄúRoots‚Äù TV mini-series was epochal.

There have been a total of 66 people killed during this annual Hoosier race in its century-long history‚Äîover 40 drivers, and dozens of mechanics, spectators, and 1 innocent child playing in his yard nearby. And while fatal tragedies are never hoped for, the high speed, risky maneuvers and crowds of over 300,000 people have always been a dangerous, thrilling combination at the Indianapolis 500. In the race‚Äôs early years, like any other sport, safety was not the utmost concern and wreck fatalities were higher. As technology, race regulations (including less flammable fuel), and conditions have improved, deaths have decreased significantly.

Released at an altitude of more than 50,000 feet, the bomb named ‚ÄúCherokee‚Äù exploded around 15,000 feet. The bomb drop was intended to gather weapon effects data for high yield air bursts, as well as demonstrate to the Soviet Union our ability to deliver H-bombs by air. So-called Operation Redwing was a series of 17 thermonuclear test detonations done from May to June, 1956. After taking control of the peaceful Marshall Islands from the Japanese in WWII, President Truman decided to conduct 66 nuclear weapons tests on the island chain from 1946 to 1958. Just before they began testing plutonium-laced hydrogen bombs‚Äîwhich have a radioactive existence of half a million years‚Äîhundreds of island native inhabitants were relocated from Bikini Atoll to Rongerik Atoll. But after bouts of starvation and other struggles to survive, some were brought back and exposed to radiation as bomb tests were conducted. The U.S. Navy brought in 242 naval ships, 156 aircraft, 25,000 radiation recording devices, and 5,400 experimental rats, goats and pigs were imported for nuclear fallout testing. And half of the world‚Äôs moving picture film stock was shipped in to document bomb drops.\nPhoto Department of Defense, Cherokee hydrogen bomb explosion on May 20, 1956. #war #nuclearbomb #hbomb #plutonium #BikiniAtoll #nuclearwar #thisdayinhistory #todayinhistory #worldhistory #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/431acfa3a706edfd8a6ba2f27188ff36/5E4F0ABE/t51.2885-15/e15/c109.0.861.861a/s640x640/13259480_1593974224246192_753448816_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BFnCDJEHGNu/", "caption": "Photo of the day\nWrestler Kairi Hojo jumps at her opponent Mieko Satomura during the Stardom female professional wrestling show at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan.

The fire is still burning today, but local residents were allowed to return to nearby homes.\nPhoto ¬©Denis Doyle/Getty Images #worldnews #fire #manvsnature #environment #tirefire #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/dd1014818ff6e3043470c7991552d51e/5E444DE2/t51.2885-15/e15/c72.0.576.576a/13102319_596684893841065_668299507_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BFbctAgnGJk/", "caption": "Happy National Nurses' Week!\nHere: Five Black nurses in a laboratory at Lincoln School of Nursing, 1929.\nPhoto courtesy Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, The New York Public Library Digital Collections #nurses #OTD #thisdayinhistory #nationalobservances #nationalnursesweek #history #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/616e3990d0ecabc54e85c0466c86246c/5E5298D5/t51.2885-15/e15/c99.0.522.522a/13167189_1336019729748682_1349353938_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BFaKFivnGBH/", "caption": "Suboxone saves lives.

Yesterday, President Obama signed a law making the grand creature a national treasure. Although sometimes referred to as a buffalo, bison are only remotely related to the true buffalo species. There are two kinds of American bison: plains bison and wood bison. Bison are strong swimmers and can reach running speeds of up to 35 mph, despite their one ton weight! In the 19th century, nearly 50 million bison were hunted for meat and hide, lowering their numbers to mere hundreds. Thanks to breeding and protection programs, there are now an estimated 150,000 bison in the US. No longer considered endangered, bison can still be hunted, farmed, and harvested as a red meat alternative.

A noted physician, businessman, and pharmacist, Pemberton came up with the popular elixir in his Atlanta drug lab. His original French Wine Coca grew out of his experiments to find a non-opiate painkiller alternative to morphine. He told a local paper it was ‚Äúcomposed of an extract from the leaf of Peruvian coca, the purest wine, and the Kola nut. It is the most excellent of all tonics, assisting digestion, imparting energy to the organs of respiration, and strengthening the muscular and nervous systems‚Ä¶ without fatigue.\" When temperance took effect, he removed the wine component, replacing it with sugary syrup, and called it Coca Cola. His drink was highly addictive due to its three main ingredients: caffeine (from the kola nut), cocaine (from the coca leaf), and sugar for flavor. His son began marketing the refreshing soda fountain drink locally for five cents a glass, and Pemberton was sure it would eventually become ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs drink.‚Äù But due to troubled finances, Pemberton sold off his shares of the company; his son sold off the final share of the patent for quick cash. John Pemberton died of stomach cancer and addicted to morphine. The owner of Coca Cola, Asa Griggs Candler, went on to market Coke into a world-dominating brand. Today, the company manufactures a non-cocaine version of the syrup and licenses the name to be sold as a soft drink in over 200 countries.\nPhoto public domain #CocaCola #todayinhistory #thisdayinhistory #softdrink #popularculture #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2cb27d8e8150c43afd0840f369f01236/5E41A2A2/t51.2885-15/e15/c0.76.612.612a/13092311_829352093863841_2025386993_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BFIIhbanGKM/", "caption": "Photo of the day\nPeople wait at a roadblock as smoke rises from wildfires near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, May 6, 2016.

Some of his theories are highly controversial and unproven (such as dream analysis and aberrant human sexuality), but nonetheless Freud‚Äôs lexicon is embedded within the vocabulary of western society‚Äîsuch as anal (personality), libido, denial, repression, cathartic, Freudian slip, Oedipus complex, daddy issues, hysteria, fixation, and neurotic.\nPhoto: Sigmund Freud in London on June 6, 1938. After the Nazi Party seized Austria‚Äîand banned Freud‚Äôs work and writings‚Äîthe doctor paid a large ransom to have his passport restored and his family moved out of the country. He was allowed to take some furniture, his library, and his collection of Greek and Egyptian antiques.\nLess than a year after his escape from Nazi rule, years of worsening oral cancer complications (including 30 surgeries) caused Freud to turn to a doctor-assisted morphine death.

Long before it was a ‚Äúdrinking holiday‚Äù, it was an historic celebration of the day an unlikely Mexican army fought back occupied French forces at the Battle of Puebla in 1862. After two civil wars that left Mexico nearly bankrupt and unable to pay foreign debts, France, Britain, and Spain sent troops to ‚Äúnegotiate‚Äù repayments. But Napolean III saw the French presence in Mexico as an opportunity to also establish the conservative Second Mexican Empire, favoring French financial interests. \nAfter pushing several towns and President Benito Juarez into retreat, the army of 6,500 well-equipped French soldiers surprisingly succumbed to a far inferior Mexican militia of 2,000 near Puebla. The victory was short-lived as France later sent another 30,000 troops to overtake Mexico and install Emperor Maximillian until the U.S. arrived with troops to oust the French in 1866. \nBut the one small victory on May 5, 1862 serves as a ‚ÄúDavid defeating Goliath‚Äù moment in Mexican history, bringing unity and pride to the people of Mexico who fought for their sovereignty. \nToday, Cinco de Mayo is an opportunity to celebrate Mexican culture, food, and music. \nPhoto: Portrait of General Ignacio Zaragoza, who lead the mighty Mexican army in the Battle of Puebla, as depicted on a 500 pesos bill, circa 1912. #cincodemayo #may5 #pesos #mexico #battleofpuebla #worldhistory #mexicanpride #todayinhistory #thisdayinhistory  #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a5ef7e9162bf4f58dfceabf43610cccf/5E5BE0EB/t51.2885-15/e15/13126759_486220461581841_410969166_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BFAaJB8nGP8/", "caption": "Photo of the day\nIn ‚ÄúA New Hope,‚Äù Princess Leia‚Äôs home planet, Alderaan, is blown to smithereens by the Empire‚Äôs Death Star as she watches in horror.

President John Adams approved $5,000 to purchase books deemed important to and for use by the Congress. The first collection contained 964 volumes (mostly law and parliamentary history) and 9 maps. On August 24, 1814, the British army invaded the White House, at all the food that had been laid out for a formal affair and looted the home, then set fire to the White House, Capitol‚Äîwhere 3,000 library books were housed‚Äîand other government buildings. One year later, Thomas Jefferson sold his nearly 7,000 books to the Library of Congress for $23,950. In 1851, another fire ravaged the Library, destroying approximately two-thirds of the collection, most of which were swiftly replaced through legislative funding. Today, the Library of Congress is the largest in the world, with over 17 million maps, manuscripts, photographs, films, artworks, audio and video recordings, prints, drawings, and ephemera.\nPhoto: Edward S.

Roosevelt signed an executive order authorizing the War Relocation Authority, which was put in charge of interning Japanese-Americans. 110,000 Japanese immigrants and Japanese-Americans on the west coast were forcibly removed from their homes and placed in the interment camps after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt calling all Japanese persons a threat to America.\nThis event struck a personal chord with famous photographer Ansel Adams when his parents' longtime employee in poor health, was summarily picked up by authorities and sent to a hospital halfway across the country in Missouri. Angered by this event, Adams welcomed an opportunity in 1943 to photograph Japanese-American internees at the Manzanar War Relocation Center in California. Adams was anxious for a more meaningful project related to the war effort. Adams's documentation of Manzanar would become his most significant war-related project.\nWhen offering the collection of over 200 photographs to the Library of Congress in 1965, Adams wrote, \"The purpose of my work was to show how these people, suffering under a great injustice, and loss of property, businesses and professions, had overcome the sense of defeat and despair by building for themselves a vital community in an arid (but magnificent) environment.‚Äù\nPhoto ¬©Ansel Adams/Library of Congress In this photo: Richard Kobayashi, cabbage farmer at Manzanar War Relocation Center, CA 1943. #todayinhistory #thisdayinhistory #AnselAdams #JapaneseHistory #AmericanHistory #internmentcamp #WPA #WWII #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/36fd5e96a465bdc73c2e4a2e4ce2e279/5E5A19F4/t51.2885-15/e15/c89.0.901.901a/s640x640/10724995_490916654366769_1772711948_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BDEz-XvHGBe/", "caption": "Can you spot the four-leaf clover in this photo?

It is most commonly associated with the assassination of Julius Caesar. The Ides of March became well-known and notorious as the official date of Julius Caesar‚Äôs assassination in the year 44 BC. Caesar‚Äôs assassination was the result of a conspiracy by a coalition of Roman senators. At the time of his assassination, Caesar was the dictator of the Roman Republic, and the senators feared his power, and that he might overthrow them in favor of general tyranny. He was murdered near the Theatre of Pompey where the Senate was meeting on the Ides of March. Before Caesar went to the theater of Pompey to attend the Senate meeting, he had been given advice not to go, but he did not listen. Caesar‚Äôs assassination transformed Roman history, as it was a central event in marking the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. His assassination resulted directly in the Liberator‚Äôs Civil War, which was waged to avenge his death. With Caesar gone, the Roman Republic did not last long, and was eventually replaced by the Roman Empire, which lasted approximately 500 years. The initial two centuries of the Roman Empire‚Äôs existence were known to be a time of supreme and unprecedented stability and prosperity. The time period came to be known as ‚ÄúRoman Peace.‚Äù\nPainting: Die Ermordung C√§sars, Karl von Piloty (1865) ¬©istockphoto\n#IdesOfMarch #JuliusCaesar #politics #todayinhistory #thisdayinhistory #worldhistory #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/db577841e5b588b8810bd88acf872e5e/5E5895B0/t51.2885-15/e15/c190.0.700.700a/s640x640/12818994_826615017466561_456878703_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BC9FkteHGCF/", "caption": "Would you spend a night in one of these hammocks?\nThe Highline Meeting Monte Piana, is an annual event that unites young people from all over the world through their shared passions for adventure and the sport of highlining.

In 2014, NASA revisited the Pillars, providing astronomers with a sharper and wider view. This time, the area was photographed in near-infrared light, as well as visible light; the infra-red pierces through dense clouds of space dust and gas, giving astronomers a clearer view. This updated study tells us the Pillars of Creations are also a place of destruction. As explained by @NASA: ‚ÄúAt the top edge of the left-hand pillar, a gaseous fragment has been heated up and is flying away from the structure, underscoring the violent nature of star-forming regions. These pillars represent a very dynamic, active process. The gaseous pillars are actually getting ionized, a process by which electrons are stripped off of atoms, and heated up by radiation from the massive stars. And then they are being eroded by the stars‚Äô strong winds and barrage of charged particles, which are literally sandblasting away the tops of these pillars.‚Äù\nPhoto courtesy NASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)/J.

His story is framed within the correspondence of North Pole explorer Captain Walton and his sister. Much to the misunderstanding of popular culture today, the monster in the story is actually without a name, reflective of Dr. Frankenstein‚Äôs rejection of his wretched creature.\nPhoto: Actor Boris Karloff in arguably the most famous cinematic ‚ÄúFrankenstein‚Äù in 1931, portraying the monster.

Upon founding Hull House in Chicago, IL, Addams became a role model for social reform, encouraging middle-class women to volunteer, uplift, and educate their communities. The first Hull House was a refuge of innovative social, educational, and artistic programs for immigrants, the poor, and women. The program eventually grew to 500 houses nationwide, and provided a newly formed position of importance for women in leadership roles at Hull Houses. Through her arduous work as a social reformer and speaker, Jane Addams paved the way for many important programs including: child labor regulation, arts enrichment, public sanitation, daycare, health and fitness, gay and lesbian rights, library branch system, juvenile courts, occupational safety, pension laws, multiculturalism, feminism, pacifism, and compulsory education, among other causes. Additionally, Addams was a co-founder of the ACLU. In 1931, she became the first American woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.\nPhoto courtesy Library of Congress @ACLU_nationwide #JaneAddams #HullHouse #WomensHistoryMonth #NobelPeacePrize #socialreform #lgbt #equality #laborlaws #ACLU #civilrights #suffragette #feminist #todayinhistory #thisdayinhistory #thedailybeast", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/8961ab35b3eaf3ea032546fa9971b2aa/5E564159/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/12797950_178567722523717_708762629_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BCZJTqfHGDx/", "caption": "Photo of the day: A reveler gets ready to dance during a pow-wow celebrating the Indigenous Peoples Day Festival in Randalls Island, New York, October 11, 2015.

The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the Pulitzer Prize for Photography in the same year as its publication, and came to be regarded in the United States as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and quite possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time. Three Marines depicted in the photograph, Harlon Block, Franklin Sousley, and Michael Strank, were killed in action over the next few days.

Founded around the birthdates of former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery in the US, it is a time to reflect upon the collective history of our culture as a result of the African diaspora. Originally Negro History Week, Kent State students launched Black History Month in 1969, and was adopted by President Ford in 1976. Ford encouraged Americans to ‚Äúseize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.‚Äù The celebrations is not without criticism, some believing assigning a month to Black history is a form of segregation.
