Users can make a restricted person's comments show up for others by approving their comments.

Hundreds of people were killed on June 4, 1989, as People's Liberation Army troops cracked down on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square. In the preceding weeks, hundreds of thousands of students and workers had gathered in the square to call for greater democracy, as well as political and social reforms. At the height of the protests, it seemed like they could be successful - but hardliners won an internal battle within the ruling Communist Party, and a crackdown was ordered. On the night of June 3, convoys of armed troops entered Beijing with an aim to clear the square by whatever means necessary. Witnesses told horrific stories of tanks driving over unarmed protesters and soldiers shooting indiscriminately into crowds. No official death toll was ever released by the Chinese government, but human rights groups estimate it was the hundreds, if not thousands. The events of June 4 have been wiped from the history books in China, and any discussion of the crackdown is strictly censored and controlled. On the 30th anniversary, no public memorials or events marking the day are expected in mainland China.

In five years of civil war, 1.9 million people have fled to camps within the country, where the UN provides physical protection as well as food rations amidst an ongoing famine. But to cook the rations, firewood must be collected from outside the camps -- a task that falls to women like Nykeer. When the women get to the forest, soldiers are often already waiting for them, hiding in the tall grass. \"If you're in the forest to collect firewood and the soldiers see you, they will rape you,\" Nykeer, a women's leader, told CNN. \nSince the beginning of the conflict in 2013, South Sudanese army soldiers have been accused of using rape and other forms of sexual violence as a tactic of war. But facing a lack of funding, the UN, which estimates that 70% of women living in camps have been raped, can‚Äôt offer free firewood or coal. And even if they could, it wouldn't address the root cause of the rape epidemic: gender inequality. #asequals (üì∑ @hannahreyesmorales)", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a3ad34b6acc64d6e1f1e3fbf56ff43a9/5E449D89/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c0.0.1079.1079a/s640x640/37671676_306742306555857_1543480795140718592_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BmAgVIPgmQv/", "caption": "An aircraft drops fire retardant to help fight the River Fire on August 1 -- one of the several wildfires burning in California. 16 of the largest infernos have scorched at least 320,000 acres.
