Ashkin's lifelong fascination with light has already saved countless lives. He shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in physics for his role in inventing a tiny object-levitating technology called optical tweezers, a powerful laser beam that can \"catch very small things,\" as Ashkin describes it. Optical tweezers can hold and stretch DNA, helping us probe some of the biggest mysteries of life.

third-party courier companies that work out of Amazon facilities. Amazon provides the companies with packages, delivery routes, navigation software, and scanning devices.\n\nIn response to this story, Amazon said, “While it is impossible to characterize a network of thousands of delivery drivers based on anecdotes, we do recognize small businesses sometimes need more support when scaling fast.” Read more via the link in our bio.", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4a2021a3591c09bbe6e435207a9eb8fa/5E5DBE38/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/c1.0.1077.1077a/s640x640/40447651_1716177661813497_8423212734016838938_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnjnonons9a/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/c9edcfc7d775f15a2129ef73f996575a/5DBF76C6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/40241639_469861930193771_1966814591705672715_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnbc85YnpsQ/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/4fde8775efbef8c5e13bcc7fb6a7f0ec/5DBFA58C/t51.2885-15/e35/c157.0.406.406a/40337977_323299558417246_4587349412118064163_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BnZjRh2Hcke/", "caption": "Journalist @realbobwoodward's new book, #Fear is full of damning allegations about the Trump administration.\n\nWoodward, a reporter who rose to fame through his coverage of the Watergate scandal, paints a chaotic picture of life within President Donald Trump's White House in the book.\n\nBased on a number of the accusations in the book, senior members of the Trump administration do not respect the president and routinely work against his wishes.\n\nTrump has called the book a \"work of fiction,\" but it has reportedly sparked a \"witch hunt\" within his administration for people who may have spoken with Woodward.\n\nWoodward's book is set to be released on September 11.

In Business Insider's latest ranking of the best colleges in America, the top schools share a few common traits: They provide a quality education and graduate students on time, they set graduates up to earn well-paying jobs early in their career, and they provide a memorable and enjoyable campus experience that instills pride and loyalty for decades to come.\n\nBusiness Insider's 2016 ranking uses a formula that relies very little on glamour statistics, like reputation and selectivity, that are featured in many college rankings. Instead, we primarily leaned on data available from the government, weighting early-career earnings and graduation rate the highest.\n\nCollege years are formative for young adults, so we also gave significant credit to schools that provide a top-notch student-life experience, as measured by Niche, a company that compiles research on schools. Niche assessed the social and community life of universities and provided letter grades based on metrics like campus quality, diversity, party scene, student retention, safety, and athletics.\n\nOther factors that counted for less and rounded out each school's score: full-time retention rate, average annual cost (after accounting for scholarships and financial aid), average SAT score of incoming students, and admittance rate. \nThe Ivy League dominated the list, taking the top three spots. But our top 10 featured a couple of surprises, too, including two top-notch universities from the South. \nPrinceton has trained a barrage of successful graduates, including 15 Nobel Prize winners, 10 National Humanities Medal winners, and 21 National Medal of Science winners. The prestigious Ivy League institution also counts President John F. Kennedy, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and author F. Scott Fitzgerald among its many distinguished alumni.

But that's not enough for the billionaire founders' ambitious international expansion plan; they are now seeking a new round of funding that would raise Airbnb's valuation to $30 billion, triple what it was just two years ago. The room-renting company has listings in 191 countries and projects that 129 million nights will be booked by year's end.\n\nThere is just one thing stopping Airbnb from further growth: government roadblocks. In early June, for instance, the city of San Francisco backed Airbnb into a corner, requiring that the company list only properties that are registered with the city. Airbnb has sued the city to protect its renters who rely on their Airbnb income.\n\nThe #SiliconValley100 is our annual list of the people who matter most and define what it means to be in Silicon Valley where Airbnb cofounders Nathan Blecharczyk, Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia are ranked number 28.

The wildly popular food festival is hosted by New York City based, large scale event planning company, Cannonball Productions.\n\nAfter studying journalism and sociology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, entrepreneur Kate Levenstien shortly discovered that she had a whole different passion — event planning. This soon sparked an idea, and at the young age of 26, Levenstien started her own successful event planning company, Cannonball Productions. \nLevenstien has always been obsessed with food. The Bacon and Beer Classic — the food and drink festival with 100 different types of craft beer and more than 50 original, bacon-infused dishes — was an idea she came up with while working at LivingSocial. Levenstien was sitting on this idea that she was really passionate about, which is one of the reasons she started her own company.\n\nThe first Bacon and Beer Classic was in 2014. The events are held in popular stadiums, and serve a large variety of bacon flavors, as well as meals made with bacon, such as bacon nachos, bacon ramen burgers, and so much more. Also, they provide the best pairing of craft beer with each flavor of bacon.\nTo find out more about founder Kate Levenstien and Cannonball Productions, visit businessinsider.com/clusterstock.\n\n#BandBClassic #bacon #beer #thirstythursday #brewfest #LTBrews #beerfest #festival #tasting #food #drinks #fun #cannonballevents #events #party #hosting #social #happyhour #citifield #craftbeer", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/e9466aadfb5892b7687c3dd1bf92baa4/5E53BA90/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/13531946_1726002080990824_1100490478_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BHSYZMFD1tu/", "caption": "Most people know the big-name European cities and landmarks.

He’s forging a true consumer-facing experience that’s leaving legacy competitors — and several internet-only streaming services — scrambling to keep up.\n\nIn 2015 alone, Netflix added 17 million subscribers, and this year, the company will add 600 hours of original content to its library of more than 100 million hours of licensed content. The company’s Netflix-made movies and television shows like “Orange is the New Black” have amassed awards, earned critical acclaim, and become audience favorites, prompting Hollywood producers and talent to come knocking at its door. Netflix has earned its place in pop culture, too, with terms like “binge-watching” — the act of viewing Netflix’s recently released shows in rapid succession — and “Netflix and chill” — code for a casual, low-key night of romance — infiltrating the modern lexicon.\n\nSimilarly, Hastings has crafted a company culture at Netflix that’s becoming the standard among Silicon Valley tech companies. From the start, Netflix employees have enjoyed unlimited vacation, but last summer the company announced a historic unlimited maternity and paternity leave policy, paving the way for forward-thinking companies to follow suit.\n\nHastings is a member of The Giving Pledge, having promised to donate the majority of his billion-dollar fortune to charity. Earlier this year, the longtime supporter of charter schools and education reform in California launched a $100 million education foundation.\n\nReed Hastings is number 28 on our #CreatorsList which ranks leaders around the world who aspire to do good in the world.

This spring, the company opened its highly anticipated second location, a LEED-certified “Liquid Center” and brewery in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nThough Jordan stepped down as CEO in 2015 — she was succeeded by longtime COO Christine Perich — she remains actively involved in the company, which now generates an estimated $225 million in annual sales.\n\nKim Jordan is number 12 on our #CreatorsList which ranks leaders around the world who aspire to do good in the world.

The site, which now sells everything from furniture to food to Amazon's own consumer-electronics products, recently became the fastest company to reach $100 billion in annual sales. And Amazon Web Services, the online retailer’s exploding cloud-computing business, is nearing $10 billion in annual sales. Amazon finally began turning consistent profits this year, helping the company’s stock price surge to all-time highs.\n\nAnd though Bezos, the chairman and CEO and now one of the richest people on Earth, has commendably led Amazon’s rise to global dominance, he has also had to weather controversy. In 2015, the company was hit with barrage of negative media attention claiming it fostered a high-pressure, toxic work environment. Bezos disputed the claims, and, despite the reports, Amazon remains a progressive employer. The company recently revealed equal gender pay among its workforce, with women employees earning 99.9% of men’s salaries in equivalent jobs.

By the early 2000s, though, Lego was struggling to manage its finances and experienced slumping sales.\n\nBut then an outsider, Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, was brought in to save the struggling toy company. When he took over in 2005, he refocused on Lego’s most important customers — kids — and put creative control into the hands of the company’s most hardcore fans.\n\nThe shift worked, and Knudstorp’s reinvigorated Lego is now one of the most popular toymakers on the planet. It has grown 15% annually the past 10 years — even while top rivals have started slipping — and pulled in $5.2 billion in revenue in 2015. The company estimates 100 million children interacted with the brand last year.\n\nA portion of those interactions have been inside the classroom through the Lego Education’s WeDo 2.0 program. The program tries to make learning more fun by teaching children about STEM fields through its robotics kits. Lego has partnered with over 20,000 schools in the US to bring its products to the classroom as a teaching tool.\n\nKnudstorp has made his company more environmentally and employee friendly as well. Improved safety measures have reduced employee injuries by 37% since 2009, while energy efficiency has increased by 24% over the same period. And in 2015, 43% of newly promoted and recruited leaders were women, according to the company’s responsibility report. \nJørgen Vig Knudstorp is number 79 on our #CreatorsList which ranks leaders around the world who aspire to do good in the world.

It began in 2006, when Mycoskie founded Toms Shoes under the audacious approach that it would both earn profits and be a force for good. With every pair of $48 canvas slip-on shoes sold, the company donated one pair to a child in a country like Haiti, Guatemala, or Argentina.\n\nThe concept took off, and Mycoskie has since expanded the company’s social mission to provide eyeglasses and eye surgeries, clean drinking water, and birth kits for mothers through the sale of eyewear, coffee, and bags. To date, Toms has given more than 60 million pairs of new shoes, restored sight for 400,000 people in 13 countries, provided 335,000 weeks of safe drinking water, and offered safe-birth services to more than 25,000 mothers. Its newest crusade is preventing teenage bullying in the US through the sale of backpacks.\n\nWhat’s more, Mycoskie has created jobs along the way. At Toms facilities in Kenya, India, and Ethiopia, a total of 500 locals produce 40% of the company’s donated shoes. And back at the Los Angeles headquarters, employees work in an open and collaborative office space with a quirky company culture — a playground-style slide runs through the middle of the office, and dogs are a welcome fixture.\n\nMycoskie, who is no longer the CEO of Toms but remains involved as its chief shoe giver, sold 50% of the company, valued at $625 million, to Bain Capital in 2014. He’s using some of that windfall to start the Toms Social Entrepreneurship Fund, his $100 million personal investment vehicle that bankrolls the next generation of social entrepreneurs.\n\n#CreatorsList #TOMs #shoes #pair #oneforone #charity #haiti #guatemala #argentina #glasses #cleanwater #antibullying #kenya #india #ethiopia #california #ceo #entrepreneur #helpful", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/74d7255926dc9f645a7e75cd18a60a7f/5E57F24A/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/13391293_522487587951529_576086059_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BGuWJrNKTGg/", "caption": "Rolls-Royce is a brand that's steeped in history and tradition, but not so much that it would prevent the company from looking forward into the future.

So with GoldieBlox, she created a line of construction toys and accompanying books that appealed to girls’ strengths while also exercising their spatial skills, a necessary skill for engineers.\n\nSterling turned to Kickstarter, where she raised nearly $1 million in preorders in three months, and began making short videos on YouTube that went viral. Six months later, GoldieBlox turned heads during a 30-second Super Bowl spot it won in a contest, earning praise for its empowering message.\n\nTo date, GoldieBlox has sold more than 1 million narrative-driven construction toys in 6,000 retailers worldwide and produced over 100 web videos.

The Metro's Expo extension, which opened in May, was part of a $14-billion project — the largest public works project in the country.\n\nAnd maybe because of the tide of cars they have to deal with every day, many Angelenos have become passionate about public transportation.\n\nIf you want to get a glimpse of the best in public transportation in Los Angeles, the Metro curates an Instagram full of beautiful bike rides on the beach and stunning sunsets glinting off trains. \n#LA #losangeles #metro #train #bike #car #traffic #commute #city #california #transportation #angelenos #transitphotography #photography #loveLAMetro 📸 courtesy of @metrolosangeles @mpkelleydotcom", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/3b7fd76548fb7b93218ac454574c1175/5E5DE7BA/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/13398410_1751722121774874_1668012486_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BGrAvfkKTLA/", "caption": "Via @businessinsideruk:\nEurope has some of the worst light pollution on the planet.

He started his career at a hedge fund and tutored his young cousins on the side, particularly in math and science. After he started uploading the lessons to YouTube in 2006, many students other than his cousins tuned in, and Khan realized he was onto something big.\n\nBy 2009, he had quit his job to devote his time to Khan Academy, a revolutionary nonprofit offering free online video tutorials to people around the globe. The company officially launched with the support of Silicon Valley elite: Founding partners include Google and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Today, Khan Academy has 40 million registered users who consume video tutorials across many subjects in multiple languages.\n\nKhan aims to close the gap between wealthy students who are able to pay for tutors and test-prep classes and low-income students without easy access to these training tools. “We have a mission for a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere,” Khan told Business Insider. Acknowledging critics, including those who find the lecture format to be limiting, he says, “I'd never say [the videos] somehow constitute a complete education. If I'm confused about something, hey, to get a 5-, 10-minute explanation of it, I think that's valuable.” Last June, Khan Academy launched free SAT-prep courses and materials in partnership with College Board, a big step forward in making higher education universally accessible. Khan also has opened the brick-and-mortar Khan Lab School in Mountain View, California — an experimental program that lets students advance at their own pace. \nSalman Khan is number 8 on our #CreatorsList which ranks leaders around the world who aspire to do good in the world.

trust to lead this country no matter what might happen,\" he said before introducing Fiorina at an Indianapolis rally.\n\nIn a nearly 30-minute long speech before Fiorina took the stage, Cruz acknowledged that it is odd to nominate a vice presidential candidate ahead of the Republican National Convention in July. \"I think all would acknowledge that this race, if anything, is unusual,\" he said, adding that no candidate will hit the needed 1,237 delegates to secure the nomination ahead of the July convention.\n\nOnce she took the stage, Fiorina said she was honored to accept Cruz's offer.\n\nShe endorsed Cruz not long after dropping out of the GOP race, and she has frequently appeared as a surrogate for the senator since. \"This is a fight for the soul of our party and for the future of the nation,\" she said.\n\nFor more on the announcement and the race for the presidency, visit businessinsider.com/politics. \n#tedcruz #carlyfiorina #hewlettpackard #ceo #nomination

The Nose lies between the two and is the most popular climb of El Cap.

I wanted a piece of art.\" Nearly 25 years later (most of which he spent working on the home part-time, though he has been working on the restoration efforts full-time for the last six years), he plans to put the home back up for sale.

Born and raised in poverty in Mississippi, Winfrey broke into the media industry as a TV news anchor in Baltimore in the 1970s, moving to Chicago in 1984 to host a morning show that a year later became \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" She hit the big time with her acting debut in 1985's \"The Color Purple,\" for which she landed an Oscar nomination.\n\nA year later she started Harpo Studios, where for 25 years she hosted her talk show, which in its peak brought in $300 million a year. Winfrey's Harpo empire would expand to include a book club that turns authors into best-sellers, a women's magazine, and a cable network, Own. It also produces films, including the 2014 critical darling \"Selma.\" Next up for Harpo? Own will start airing scripted TV dramas; \"Greenleaf,\" a show about a Memphis church, will be Winfrey's first acting gig for the network.\n\nIn October, Winfrey announced a 10% ownership stake in the weight-loss company Weight Watchers, causing the stock to double in value.

Our ranking of the 50 most powerful people in the world inspired us to look at what the top power people have to say about influence, ambition, command, and leadership.\n\nApproval ratings for Vladimir Putin, Russia's president and former prime minister, reached an all-time high in October: 89.9%. After seizing Crimea last year in the wake of the Ukrainian Revolution, Putin is determined to resurrect Russia as a superpower. In the past year, he's supported a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine, and launched a military operation in support of Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Unlike with most Western heads of state, Putin's control over Russia is subject to few constitutional checks and balances. At the annual UN meeting in late September, Putin criticized Obama, asserting that US interventions have backfired in the Middle East, creating a haven for extremists and terrorists. Shortly after, Putin launched the Russian air campaign to target Islamic forces in Syria and weaken rebellion against the country’s president. The airstrikes are costing Russia an estimated $2.5 million a day, and are quickly escalating tensions with Western powers. He claims the third spot on our list of the 50 most powerful people.

Only cars that have been driven by the reporters are eligible, and we consider everything from the driving experience to the story the car tells.\n\nSeveral major factors guided our choice. The bottom line is the XC90 has so much going for it that it was ultimately a challenge to not choose it. The XC90 found itself up against the new BMW 7 Series, the Audi S3 sports sedan, the Lamborghini Huracán supercar, the McLaren 675LT track-ready supercar, and the Tesla Model X. There's no doubt that it's feature- and technology-packed, a joy to drive, and exceptionally versatile and comfortable. For Volvo, it's a triumphant move in a new but not radically different direction. It's earned all the great press it's gotten in 2015. And it's a worthy BI Car of the Year!
