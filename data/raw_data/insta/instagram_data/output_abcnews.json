So US Forces have allowed TERRORISTS to continue their CHAOS while thousands of CIVILIANS have given their LIFE for nothing! But of course you prefer to present Turkey during his YPG operation as an CIVILIAN killer, they are far away from this, KING of WAR CRIMES with great distance is still USA, your LIES will not change this circumstance!!! YPG TERRORISTS were trained and armed for years at borders of Turkey, looks like USA prefers to BOMB civilians instead of ISIS TERRORISTS and to arm the ENEMIES of his NATO ALLY 🇹🇷 instead of helping him against terror.
