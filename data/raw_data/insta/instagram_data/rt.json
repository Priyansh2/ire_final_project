The accusation stems from analysis of social media, interviews with witnesses, data provided by local plane spotters and records of communications of the Russian military deployed in Syria. The bombings, which happened on May 5 and 6, are just a faction of attacks on civilian infrastructure, for which Moscow carries responsibility, the newspaper alleged.\n\nResponding to the accusation on Monday, the Russian military said Times report was flawed for several reasons, including failure to explain that Idlib Governorate, where the four alleged bombings took place, lives under rule of brutal jihadists. That detail affects the entire narrative, indicating its flawed sourcing. ‚ÄúGadgets, modern radio scanners, protected notebooks, internet connection are all things that the local civilian population simply cannot afford. They are more interested in daily surviving under the yoke of the terrorists,‚Äù said Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov.\n\nHe added there were inconsistencies with other parts of the report, in particular a claim that a Russian pilot received coordinates for his target openly on the air, which would have been in violation of military operating procedures.\n\nHe also questioned identification of one of the locations named by the Times as a civilian hospital, saying it was not clear how one can operate in a remote cave. ‚ÄúJust a week ago we took over 80 journalists from leading Russian and international media to a cave located in that general area.

This week, Donald Trump ordered troops to withdraw from northern Syria, and received a huge wave of criticism, with many accusing him of betraying the US-backed Kurdish militia. ‚ÄúWe went to war under a false & now disproven premise, weapons of mass destruction. There were none!‚Äù Trump tweeted. The reason for the withdrawal is not only the loss of millions of lives in these wars, but the waste of money, which according to the president is $7 billion. Other reports say it was $3.6 trillion over the period between 2001 and 2016.\n\nLater, the president tweeted: ‚ÄúIn case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria.‚Äù", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/2550d8084e0f20eb4e069ce2331d689f/5E4D8131/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70732526_2538644596179413_2623132083148707028_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ca_NGhVvo/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/a2f015ffc5e8279a9015f72d45255976/5DBE9275/t51.2885-15/e35/70540445_194071034931207_1541364924888233649_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3cWJZJn3gv/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/7e2c88420355a100952511ae793432cf/5DBE5E6E/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70620770_719881285196888_3816109965357653794_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3cOsTJH5Ej/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/5d29df2ed87e8fb65855cc2167c2f777/5DBF6766/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/72070059_161427204935375_8437147832549416285_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3cGcd8naU9/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/0dff2189d772cb52a35d2e54fd8cd0dc/5DBE73C6/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/71525543_171203230686492_6136437785149264182_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3b0powHkBf/", "caption": "", "img_url": "https://instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/48e30f2852d5099ec319948b809a8f10/5DBF43B3/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/70887779_712317425939272_6930590726059734482_n.jpg?_nc_ht=instagram.fmaa8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3byUazHjwZ/", "caption": "Norwegian apprentice chef cooks her own horse, gets death threats\n\nPia Olden‚Äôs horse Drifting Speed was put down in 2018 due to illness.
