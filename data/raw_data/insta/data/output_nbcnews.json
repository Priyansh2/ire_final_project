But, I rarely have thought that our well-meaning imperialism or policing of the world had a selfish, protracted, malicious, or mean-spirited agenda except for the Iraq war, but that is another issue for another time.\nThe current regime looks at it's actions in Syria as a means to an end, a way to make money regardless of lost human lives, and to further our president's esteem in Putin's eyes. trump, (I refuse to capitalize his name), only sees the world for how it can benefit him and those around him that supposedly approve of him. He doesn't care about ordinary people's lives, their ability to feed a family, or how the condition of the environment impacts the quality of life. His only concern is his skewed view of the world through an artificially inflated ego and what he assumes is an enviable bank account.\nPlease know that there are many Americans that are just as confused as the rest of the world as to how to move on from here, but please don't lose faith in us, we have had setbacks before and always recovered.

During my lengthy stay at the hotel I experienced and observed negative and bias behaviors that I never thought I would at a Hilton Brand Hotel in the year 2019 and had attempted to address some of my concerns with the Assistant GM. Though a few employees (mainly some housekeeping staff) were pleasant and accommodating, numerous employees including management treated me unkindly. After I checked out I submitted a lengthy document to CEO Christopher Nassetta and Hilton's Guest Services regarding my concerns, experience and observations. There after, I copied the Executive Ambassador assigned to my case and the CEO on all my correspondence with the Hampton Inn's General Manager N. Dinardo as I realized and observed that some employees including management lack integrity. I ended up having two telephone calls with the GM, our second conversation included the Vice President of Hospitality F Falcochi. One of the first thing the GM mentioned when she called was that there is a team put in place to address some of my concerns including the topic of Inclusion at the hotel. However, during the course of our conversation I over heard a lot of negatives because these employees are simply callous and unprofessional and because the GM was not forthright from the beginning regarding my experience at the hotel-she mentioned she feared being fired. She admitted to the VP during our conversation that everything I was mentioning and had submitted in my document is factual. I clearly overheard the VP of Hospitality tell her \"I told you not to hire them, I didn't say to treat them badly.\" I was shocked and disturbed by what I heard but decided to proceed with the conversation politely; intent on further addressing concerns/issues with Hilton Corporate. I was concerned that there is a 'culture of exclusion' at the front desk level which I also addressed in the document submitted; my observation was correct @nbcnews"}, {"author": "adrienne44556677", "comment": "I'm going to presume that's how it really went down.

We've made mistakes. We've taken the wrong side occasionally, we've tried to push western ideals on countries that prefer not to be enlightened with democracy, and sometimes we have caused the loss of human lives in the process. But, I rarely have thought that our well-meaning imperialism or policing of the world had a selfish, protracted, malicious, or mean-spirited agenda except for the Iraq war, but that is another issue for another time.\nThe current regime looks at it's actions in Syria as a means to an end, a way to make money regardless of lost human lives, and to further our president's esteem in Putin's eyes. trump, (I refuse to capitalize his name), only sees the world for how it can benefit him and those around him that supposedly approve of him. He doesn't care about ordinary people's lives, their ability to feed a family, or how the condition of the environment impacts the quality of life. His only concern is his skewed view of the world through an artificially inflated ego and what he assumes is an enviable bank account.\nPlease know that there are many Americans that are just as confused as the rest of the world as to how to move on from here, but please don't lose faith in us, we have had setbacks before and always recovered.
