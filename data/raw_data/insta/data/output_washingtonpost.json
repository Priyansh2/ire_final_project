Trump clearly sought to pressure and extort foreign assistance to attack a political rival.

That in an investigation on that matter, had already cleared Biden of any wrong doing, years prior. And still out of the blue right before elections, with no new evidence or developments to warrant such an investigation, Trump sought to get Ukraine to do it. Using the power entrusted to the President to push a foreign government into expensive personal favors is criminal. Getting a foreign power to assist you in misleading the American people for the purpose of affecting the outcome of our election, is criminal and treasonous. And let’s be clear. An investigation of that nature cost money. As the GOP likes to point out when referring to the Mueller investigation. Only an ignorant person or a lawyer would try to defend Trump’s criminal transgressions. But wait there is more guilt, if you order now I will throw in the guilty fact that Trump violated the freedom of information act in an effort to hide the treason, or as the GOP says. The “no wrong doing”. I guess Trump and Co. just like to hide random “beautiful perfect” calls with classified information, for no reason. That makes total sense. And the bad guy isn’t the guy who clearly committed the crime. No, the bad guy is the one who went through proper procedure to call out the crime? That is perfect beautiful head injury level logic.

A neighbor said that he dialed a non-emergency line and requested a welfare check when he noticed that the door was ajar and the lights were on. While searching the outside of the house, police said, an officer saw someone standing near a window. “Perceiving a threat the officer drew his duty weapon and fired one shot striking the person inside the residence,” police said. Body camera footage released Saturday shows one officer approaches a closed first-floor window and shines a flashlight inside, then swiftly raises his gun. “Put your hands up! Show me your hands!” he yells. A split-second later, he fires a shot through the window. He does not identify himself as an officer in the footage. At a news conference in Dallas on Monday, Jefferson's family released a statement calling for the officer to be fired and charged.", "key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/B3m6aLVnW2V/"}, {"comments": [{"author": "q6xir", "comment": "#sava_the_iraqi_people 💔"}, {"author": "rx_0m", "comment": "#sava_the_iraqi_people"}, {"author": "191.98", "comment": "@amoshi_alrawi"}, {"author": "lucia_innamon", "comment": "I'm not trying to convince you or promote anyone but sincerely speaking @nikkwarren is an investment and forex trading expert so far here on IG .

Dessa videos är idag från protestaktionerna i Irak mot den korrupta staten! Allt folket kräver är jämställdhet och en icke korrupt stat som alla ledare hycklar pengar från och flyttar till ett annat land. Polisen och armén i Irak är mot staten men då kallar staten in säkerhetsstyrkor från grannlandet Iran och USA som har en inflytesrik makt i Irak med dom varaktiga smutsiga ledarna i landet! Staten har stängt ner internet och vatten nu för ungefär en timme sedan så att ingen kan lägga upp videos på sociala medier och förbjuder massmedia att filma det som sker så att omvärlden inte kan se det fruktansvärda som pågår. Tänk dig att det bara är första dagen och konsekvenserna har lett till över 10 döda och 200+ skadade, det är bara första dagen och kommer att fortsätta och leda till grymmare konsekvenser. Den Iranska och amerikanska säkerhetsstyrkorna använder tårgas, syraattacker och skjuter mot civila som ni ser i videoklippen! I en av videoklippen ser ni hur dom kraftfulla Iranska och Amerikanska säkerhetsstyrkorna knivhugger och slår civila med basebollträ vid en Milkshake Bar där det hänger mycket folk. En annan video ser hur en person dör av explosion av en handgranat.

Dr. Roxana Mehran, interventional cardiologist at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City said: \"Stents are basically a metal caging that keeps the artery open,\" Mehran added. \"Usually these are medicated stents.

What's most important for people to understand: We're not opening up anyone's chest,\" she said. \"We like people to get up and move the next day. I think we would tell people to take a few days off before they ratchet it up, because we just want the arteries to heal.\" Bernie is likely going to be just fine!

The recent shooting in Texas was wrong and the officer should be punished, as should any officer who shoots anyone illegally, regardless of their skin color.

With nearly flawless execution of an extremely difficult routine, Biles claimed her 24th world medal that broke a tie with Vitaly Scherbo of Belarus, who set the long-standing mark of 23 in the 1990s. Biles scored a whopping 15.066 points on the afternoon’s most technically demanding routine to win gold. China’s Liu Tingting (14.433) and Li Shijia (14.300) took silver and bronze, respectively. Fellow American Kara Eaker, 16, of Grain Valley, Mo., placed fourth. Biles, 22, the reigning Olympic and five-time world champion in the prestigious all-around competition, is expected to extend her world-record mark later Sunday when she competes on floor exercise, the final event in what is likely her final world championships.

The off-duty cop said she thought she was in her unit, one floor below, and that the 26-year-old Jean was burglarizing her home. Many saw the shooting as another egregious example of a white officer killing an unarmed black man, part of a pattern of police wielding deadly force disproportionately against people of color.

Experts say the photos could be a warning that a major announcement is on the way. In North Korea’s state mythology, Mount Paektu is supposed to be the spiritual home of the Kim dynasty and the birthplace of Kim Jong Un’s father. Kim allegedly “climbed” the 9,000-foot peak in shiny black leather shoes in December 2017, around 10 days after launching the country’s largest intercontinental ballistic missile, and less than a month before delivering a key speech that opened a diplomatic window for engagement with South Korea. This time, Kim supposedly “personally” rode the horse up the mountain. Some speculated that the dictator’s latest trip could signal a major announcement, amid faltering nuclear diplomacy with the United States. Read more by clicking the link in our bio.

They have then utilized their comprehensive data on people around the world to build a behemoth of an ad business worth billions upon billions. They built their business on people’s facts. So why does Mark settle and say that spreading misinformation is ok? Oh that’s right, because it drives his business too. A CEO’s job is to grow a company. So why is the media or public continually surprised when CEOs make decisions thinking about the health and growth prospects of their company? And not take into account the climate, human rights, etc. Because their job is to follow the money. So how can we expect them to behave any differently? We cannot.

In recent weeks, thousands of Mexican adults and children have been camping out in queues at U.S. border crossings, sleeping in tents while awaiting a chance to apply for safe refuge.

As Farrow recounts, Weinstein arrayed not just some big legal guns to thwart him and other reporters, but a host of black-ops characters. “I don’t want this to sound like woe is me, but I’ll be honest,” Farrow says. “It’s really hard when you’re in those moments . . . when you wonder if you’re being followed, and it turns out you are, it’s frightening.” Read more by clicking the link in our bio.

There was a massive red sign that read: “Kurds lost 11,000 lives.

The newcomer was walking the final steps of an improbable 15,000-mile odyssey. There to greet him were four others who had followed the same epic path to an American life, along with a native-born citizen clutching a hand-drawn, red-and-blue sign: “Welcome to Texas!” None would have been there had Trump had his way. In a nearly three-year campaign that has encompassed walls, travel bans and the forced separation of children from their parents, the Trump administration has reshaped vast tracts of the U.S. government’s approach toward refugees and immigration. But in one of his first attempts to bend policy to his will — an effort to block the arrival of refugees who had been detained by the Australian government on remote South Pacific islands — Trump lost. “I guarantee you they are bad,” the president said during a testy exchange with the Australian prime minister a week after his inauguration. “That is why they are in prison.” Now more than 600 of them are in the United States, living freely from California to Georgia and dozens of places in between. After enduring years locked up by Australia for seeking asylum, they are making the most of their second chance — finding jobs, honing their English and putting down roots in a country half a world away from the one they had intended to reach.

Being kind is super important but it’s also nuanced. “We can respectfully disagree up until the point where your disagreement is rooted in the denial of my rights and of personhood” -James Baldwin"}, {"author": "sknapp112", "comment": "@accessibiltypunk I agree. it is harder and more difficult. My disagreement is in no way rooted in the denial of your rights or anyone else's. NO ONE should be denied their \"personhood\" or \"individuality\".....period. It is the uniqueness of each person and the acceptance of each other's personality, race, religion, gender, scars, drama and love that makes for beautiful, happy and healthy relationships. I think most of us who live in the real world have experienced some level of hate, bigotry and ugliness. But I have learned, that it's those people who need kindness the most. I will always try with those people, At the end of the day, I will know that I tried and that those people who refuse to accept or even listen, will forever be stuck with themselves. It's those who are open to listening that I will give my time to. My post was directed to the media. They seem to believe that the average person is not kind. And their negative and sometimes downright hateful reporting of what and who they deem is wrong and unworthy is really getting old. They ALL speak with forked tongues, depending on their audience and agenda. So I really don't think we need to agree to disagree, unless of course you don't like classic disco and Cafe Del Mar music!
