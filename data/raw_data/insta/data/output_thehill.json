These people don’t think for themselves, they don’t even know why they call trump such terrible names. That have no idea about history and they think facts are hurtful and must be buttered up.

Unless you truly are hypnotized and have no idea what you’re even talking about.. The KKK was and always will be a Democrat organization and the Nazis were and always have been progressive authoritarian liberals. Look up an image search of the Democratic national conventions of the 1920s. They’re all wearing KKK attire. Sorry, but you are all being played like idiots by the liberal media and need to be woken up, so I’m here to wake you up. The liberal media can try to change history all they want but your party has always been atrocious crooks, bigots, and murderers. You fools might fall for it but many of us actually did our homework. We are sick of hate filled jerks like you that refuse to think for themselves... Are you scared that you might be ostracized by the sea of liberals that flood the cities of America? You coward...

But the anons do... forget both political parties. It’s now beyond that. It’s good vs evil at this point.

Same with #fakenews and Hollywood. Problem for the left here is the awakening by the populate. If it 50/50 or less you wouldn't see so much attempted deception. Truth is it's the economy. Identity politics on the left disintegrated. In my community alone his support is pushing 35-40%, the most progressive sector in human catagory. You dont have to agree, I'm not selling a damn thing. I'm explaining truth. For almost 2 decades we all suffered economic despair, today those days are gone. Under Obama I personally was homeless. Today in 2 years I paid off my house and rental properties. The Fake news and obvious corrupt establishment have tried hard to foster discontent with identity politics but they can litterly go fuck themselves as this transgender American is concerned. Truth is also our country's establishment is pumping drugs into America's veins via organized crime in bed with swamp creatures. I know what I am talking about. Prior to my political conversion and awakening I worked as a manager for New England's 1st trans strip club. The fact this president is going after this jugular is amazing. The lives he already saved from this have been countless. I buried dozens of my own kind on this journey from the meth these great Democrats been pumping into the Nation's rainbow neon red light districts. This is a war on drugs. This is a war for the betterment and safety of Americans. The political puppet show and talking heads are good at snokeshows and distractions but they lost their power in face of the awakening. Wether you like him or not, the guy done a lot of great things for Americans.

If Trump fires him for doing his job in the absence of wrong doing, Trump will once again be guilty of OBSTRUCTION. You realise of course it only takes a single misdemeanor to be charged with Obstruction. Trump's got several instances already of attempting to shut down an active criminal investigation already. Indictment B is still sealed and unserved as yet. There are those who speculate the two collusionists, Trump and Pense will be named. Time will tell and History will not be kind to Trump nor the GOP. Not only is there already verification of most of the Steele Dossier turned over to the CIA, Obama and Reviewed in full (audios included)! By Congressional oversight but 13 independent allied countries have produced coroberation of the Russians in communication with Trump's campaign. There's a mountain of evidence and witness accounts by those under plea agreement as well as those in government office who have testified to Mueller and Congressional oversight. Mueller brought down Capone and Gotti which took time and Trump will be cake by comparison. Rosenstein is not directly involved with the investigation as an interested party or part of those under scrutiny therefore recusal isn't necessary. Sessions who met at the Mayflower with Trump, Pense, McConnel, DeVos and a host of crooks like Gates, Page, Popodopolous Manafort and Flynn (in photos) with Kyslak, Gorkos and Butina (now in Federal custody), Russian spies recused himself as required because HE'S INVOLVED! This \"Witch Hunt\" has netted 19 Witches, Over 100 charges, 5 convictions on guilty pleas with 2 serving time already. The fact wrong doing has been uncovered justifies this investigation and legally merits its continuation. If you understood our Constitution you'd know how unconstitutional it is to suggest any interference with an active criminal investigation like this is. It took over 2 years to get Nixon and Mueller will be there as soon as all his ducks are in a row. The majority of the country already see the writing on the wall.

Like you, Obama was not my first cup of tea. In the healthcare industry I realised quite early that the crooked Insurance industry has one agenda. Pay for nothing they can get out of EVEN when covered and charge whatever you can get out of. Obama was listening to the insurance company and not those of us actually in the jobs. After VERY VOCAL comment online and 20 years at the job, I got an invitation to participate in a white papers hearing before members of the Senate Finance Committee. I accepted and worked closely with several Senate members. You might recognise Senators Susan Collins, Diane Feinstine, Joel Anderson and Barbara Boxer. Both sides of the isle listened. I got a call from one of Michelle Obama's aides for clarification on topics like pre-existing condition exclusions, HMO vs PPO options etc. Anyway my point is just because one is \"labeled\" or \"aligns\" right or left does not make their opinions less valid. I hear both sides. It's called listening. Compromise is always better than impass. That's what made ACA work. The premium is solely a combination of things NONE of which is affected by anything Obama did. That's the irony. It's only ACCESS to the exchanges the government has at pennies on the dollar. When Trump goes out of his way to threaten ACA it panics the Industry driving premium costs up to prepare for mass Exodus from their plans. When employers don't have to offer any benefit or decide to reduce shared expense, your out of pocket increases. The success of ACA is proven. I wasn't a full time employee years before and as a result could get affordable access. Now even part time employees can get group rates. There's a whole lot more good than bad. My premiums due to pre-existing, age, health etc was $ 899.00", "author": "eyler.linda"}, {"comment": "@eyler.linda Before ACA now It's $77.41 so it works for me. I have now retired and I'm watching my stretched budget shrink thanks to every damn thing Trump messes in. Give him a chance? On day one his transition team were caught attempting to remove Classified Documents out of the office! Then his whole history as a sexual preditors goes against my moral compass. The rape of Katie Johnson when she was just 13 in Jeffrey Epstein's New York condo filed in NY and dropped only after Trump's lawyer threatened her and her family ( like he did so many other women) made my choice a no brainier. The constant inability to tell the truth, his total lack of education, knowledge on most issues and his \"us vs them\" approach to government makes him unqualified and it's globally embarrassing. He had a chance and has yet to do anything redeeming. You can support him however misguided I might believe it is but for God sake keep in mind that this country is a great country because we of equal Justice, equal rights and is because we follow the Constitution. I do not agree with anything Trump stands for but I defend his and your right to believe it. That includes idiotic beliefs like the wall makes us safer or that deregulating is good for the economy or that striping our rights to litigate product failures, preditory loans and junk insurance policies. I am appalled at how he was able to manipulate the Electoral college(and I'm a touch screen inspector).
