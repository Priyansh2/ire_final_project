WASHINGTON’s true birthdate will never be proven; however, April 5, 1856 is the date most commonly recognized as his birthday.\n•\nAfter the Civil War, Booker and his mother moved from Virginia to West Virginia. Washington found work with his stepfather in the salt furnaces, and went to school part time, thanks to the support of a white employer who saw his potential.\n•\nAt 16, Washington began studies at what is now Hampton University, again with the help of a white benefactor. By 1879, he was teaching there, and by 1881, he was tapped to found what’s now known as Tuskegee University, serving as University President until his death in 1915.\n•\nDespite his undeniable contributions to the education of African Americans, Washington’s public outlook and prescriptions for how to achieve equality varied quite a bit from the tactics of blacks born free in the North...and his private revolutionary activities often contradicted his public ones. Washington’s approach caused division among other black activists, including W.E.B. Du Bois, and led to the snarky nickname ‘The Great Accomodator.’ Meanwhile, white people were surprised to discover that black people considered Washington a sellout. But was he?\n•\nIn the words of the New Yorker’s Kelefa Sanneh:\n•\n“He claimed that the racial problems of America, and particularly of the South, would slowly work themselves out, but he also claimed that there would be hell to pay if anyone tried to hurry that process along. Although his optimism was discredited in his own lifetime, his pessimism still reverberates.” #bookertwashington #education #history #blackhistory #americanhistory #virginia #westvirginia #hamptonuniversity #tuskegeeuniversity #education #activism #equality #equalrights #civilrights #historicalfigures #learnsomething #quotes #throwbackthursday #tbt #happybirthday #hbd #restinpeace #restinpower"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bcp9tfanHqM/", "caption": "#Comic by @mattbors\n#WhosNext? #MeToo #NoMoore #NoMeansNo #comics #consent #tooreal #comicstrip #dailykos #frontpage #humor"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BuZiUv9hLrj/", "comments": [{"comment": "Is she referring to Trump propping up Ben Carson?", "author": "thatshitsgottago"}, {"comment": "@thatshitsgottago I think she meant Kanye but I’m not sure", "author": "alexandre.salamandre"}, {"comment": "@thatshitsgottago She is referring to Lynne Patton.", "author": "elegantkittenmittens"}, {"comment": "#impeachTHERACISTMFTRAITOR", "author": "krollteri878"}], "caption": "\"I just want to put on the record, as being a black American and having endured the public comments of racism from the sitting president, as being a black person, I can only imagine what's being said in private.\" -Representative Brenda Lawrence #Cohen #CohenHearing"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BeEClLIHa8O/", "comments": [{"comment": "😄👍", "author": "ferygallo"}, {"comment": "This rocks!

She met her first husband, Medgar, while studying at Alcorn A&M College–one of the only schools in Mississippi that accepted black students at the time. As Medgar Evers became a rising star in the local NAACP, she fought for civil rights alongside him.\n—\nAfter her husband's death in 1963, Evers-Williams fought tirelessly for justice for his murderer, who was not convicted until the 1990s. At the same time, she and her children moved to California to forge a new, hopefully safer life. She worked in advertising and community affairs during the 70s, and also gave speeches for the NAACP. She wrote a book chronicling Medgar's life, and even ran (unsuccessfully) for Congress in 1970.\n—\nAfter decades of serving her new hometown of Los Angeles, she was appointed to the city's board of Public Works in 1987. As a member of the NAACP board during a time of turmoil, she opted to run for chair in 1995, and won. During her three-year tenure she turned the organization's reputation and financials around, and stepped down in 1998. She later went on to establish the Medgar Evers Institute, in Mississippi.\n—\nIn recent years, Evers-Williams, twice a widow, continues to speak out about racial inequality, and write books about her own journey and that of her first husband. She's received at least 7 honorary doctorates over the years, been honored as Ms. Magazine's Woman of the Year, and received the National Freedom Award in 2009.\n—\nAfter Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, Evers-Williams became the first woman of any race, and the first non-clergy, to deliver an invocation at a presidential inauguration.\n✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼 #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistory #MyrlieEvers #MedgarEvers #NAACP #Heroes #Sheroes #Activist #CivilRights #Justice #1960s #Mississipi #California #Writers #Authors"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BhhJu5rgw0L/", "comments": [{"comment": "👍🏽👏🏽👍🏽", "author": "anabua8"}, {"comment": "Yes! #respect", "author": "dominicpace1"}, {"comment": "This ought to be no big deal- talented tough woman gets job that suits her talents.

A vocal protestor of the Vietnam War, and a champion of racial equality and equity, Shakur was often a focus of police investigation and frequent surveillance. In May 1973, a supposedly routine traffic stop ended with the death of Shakur's friend and a NJ state trooper, and Shakur's arrest.\n🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨\nBetween 1973 and 1977, Shakur was indicted ten times, leading to seven trials for various crimes. Three charges were dismissed, and she was acquitted of three others. However, despite numerous medical experts claiming that she couldn't have possibly shot and killed anyone with her own bullet wounds, Shakur was convicted of NJ State Trooper Werner Foerster's murder in the spring of 1977. By November 1979, Shakur escaped, with the help of the BLA, ultimately resurfacing in Cuba, where she's been living in exile ever since.\n🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺\nToday, Shakur remains on the FBI's most wanted list, and Donald Trump has rescinded Obama's \"Cuban Thaw\" policies, specifically citing his intention to get Shakur back stateside, referring to her as \"the cop–killer Joanne Chesimard.\" Shakur has since written two books: Assata: An Autobiography (1987), and Still Black, Still Strong (1993); despite her exile, her influence can be seen in music, art, and activism today.\n✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼\n#BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistory #AmericanHistory #USHistory #WomensHistory #BlackWomen #Women #AfricanAmerican #AssataShakur #Protests #Activism #Activists #Cuba #NewYork #NewJersey #NorthCarolina #Authors #MostWanted #BlackPanther #BLA #1970s #Fugitive"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt_dM_oB6rx/", "comments": [{"comment": "#stopTHIEVINGrepugGOP #stopREPUGliesandsupression #impeachTHERACISTMFTRAITOR", "author": "krollteri878"}, {"comment": "✊", "author": "sunshineresistance"}, {"comment": "That's EXACTLY what it's leading to...", "author": "natosha_evans"}], "caption": "#History"}, {}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BgO42_onZKQ/", "comments": [{"comment": "#TribeVibes", "author": "the___tribe"}, {"comment": "great pic!", "author": "lamarvelamusic"}], "caption": "Out of the 323 performers who have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, only 45 are women or groups that include women.

Later, during WWII, the US military trained the pacifist in mechanical engineering.\n•\nAfter fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, Vonnegut, along with 50 other Allied soldiers, was taken captive and moved to Dresden. As a POW, he survived a brutal Allied attack on the city by hiding in an underground meat locker.\n•\nAfter the war, Vonnegut married his childhood sweetheart and they both enrolled at the University of Chicago; neither would graduate, but they did go on to have three children of their own, in addition to adopting Vonnegut's three nephews after his sister's death. Vonnegut and his wife would later part amicably; he had another child with his second wife.\n•\nVonnegut's writing career grew slowly. While working as a reporter, and then a publicist, he began selling short stories on the side. When he decided to write full-time in 1951, he had no idea it would be 18 years before his first commercial success, SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, would be published.\n•\nThough he never managed to achieve the same runaway success of SLAUGHTERHOUSE, Vonnegut continued to write, teach, and speak his mind until his death.

Remarkably, she won, in one of the first legal victories for a black person suing a white one. ✊🏿✊🏾✊🏾✊🏼\nTruth devoted her life to abolishing slavery, and was considered a radical even within those circles, because she also advocated for women's rights and chastised those who focused solely on the rights of black men. By 1850, she was giving speeches to audiences increasingly open to the fight against slavery, including her iconic \"Ain't I a Woman\" speech in Akron, Ohio. Her focus went beyond abolition after the Emancipation Proclamation, as she focused on prison reform, desegregation, and eliminating capital punishment. She continued to give speeches until her age kept her home.

By the time he was 25, he'd co-founded the Black Panther Party with Bobby Seale. Though the BPP was consistently characterized as violent militants by the media and the FBI, their Ten Point Plan aimed to improve life for African-Americans. They fought for better housing, jobs, healthcare, and education for black in the United States; they fought against police brutality at the hands of white officers in urban areas like Oakland. Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Newton stood accused and was convicted of of numerous violent crimes, once exiling himself in Cuba for three years to avoid prosecution. Newton eventually went on to earn his doctorate in social philosophy in 1980; after spending the last years of his life battling addiction, he was killed during a 1989 drug deal, near the same Oakland neighborhoods he'd sought to improve.\n✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽\n#BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistory #History #AmericanHistory #USHistory #California #Oakland #HueyNewton #BlackPanther #BlackPanthers #BlackPantherParty", "author": "dailykos"}], "caption": "Students across the country are standing up and demanding that we keep them safe from harm.

The confirmation proceedings should be postponed until the new Congress is seated in January 2019.\n\nKennedy, a Republican, often served a critical swing vote on issues such as abortion and affirmative action.

The great majority of the immigrants pay taxes and contribute to FICA as a way to demonstrate that they do their part to live by the law and are contributing to society.", "author": "ruthschrei"}, {"comment": "Another repukelican liar‼️😡💩🤬", "author": "boogiebootychloe"}, {"comment": "OK, PLEASE LISTEN, I WILL TELL YOU A FAIRY TALE... 🌙 📖Once upon a time📖 there was a little boy that wanted to travel around the world...🌍 It's up to you to fill this story 🎆⏳ PS.

As he ascended through the ranks of the Anglican Church, both at home and in England, Tutu used his religious clout to fight apartheid, becoming the first black man to hold increasingly significant leadership positions within the church. As his prominence reached an international scale, the South African government hesitated to make a martyr out of him, so he was able to avoid severe state-sanctioned retribution in ways that non-clergy activists like Nelson Mandela were not.\n—\n\nAs the so-called \"moral conscience of South Africa,\" Tutu has long supported reconciliation and forgiveness rather than retribution and resentment, and received criticism for being too quick to believe that unity was possible among the races. Though officially retired, Tutu has continued to fight for human rights, speaking out against everything from the war in Iraq to the occupation in Palestine; and calling for a united global response to the AIDS epidemic and climate change. He equates homophobia and limitations on LGBTQ rights with racism and apartheid, and is dismissive of those in the church who say otherwise.\n—\n\nTutu's wife LEAH is also an educator and activist.

With the help of Rosa Parks and the @NAACP, her battle for justice sparked outrage across the United States and beyond, before attention drifted away from the plight of black women (a problem that still persists today). Though two all-white, all-male grand juries failed to indict, Mrs. Taylor finally received formal apologies from the state of Alabama, her county, and her hometown in 2011.\n\nShe would have been 98 on Sunday.

He never made it home, because he was shot to death by George Zimmerman, an armed neighborhood watchman who followed the teenager, despite 911 orders telling him not to. Trayvon was unarmed, yet Zimmerman was later acquitted, under the Gunshine State's \"Stand Your Ground\" laws. This injustice led to the creation of #BlackLivesMatter, the brainchild of radical activists ALICIA GARZA, PATRISSE CULLORS, and OPAL TOMETI.\n—\nIn the words of the @blklivesmatter team: \"(Black Lives Matter) is now a member-led global network of more than 40 chapters. Our members organize and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.\n\nBlack Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise. It is an affirmation of Black folks’ humanity, our contributions to this society, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.\n\nAs organizers who work with everyday people, BLM members see and understand significant gaps in movement spaces and leadership. Black liberation movements in this country have created room, space, and leadership mostly for Black heterosexual, cisgender men—leaving women, queer and transgender people, and others either out of the movement or in the background to move the work forward with little or no recognition. As a network, we have always recognized the need to center the leadership of women and queer and trans people. To maximize our movement muscle, and to be intentional about not replicating harmful practices that excluded so many in past movements for liberation, we made a commitment to placing those at the margins closer to the center.\"\n✊🏿✊🏾✊🏽✊🏼 Rest in power, Trayvon.\n—\n#BlackLivesMatter #Trayvon #TrayvonMartin #RIPTrayvon #OnThisDay #2012 #Zimmerman #GeorgeZimmerman #NeighborhoodWatch #StandYourGround #GunshineState #Florida #SunshineState #Sanford #GoneTooSoon #RestInPeace #RestInPower #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #NeverAgain #SayHisName"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Be1Jxi9HVH0/", "caption": "#BlackHistoryMonth #BlackHistory #History #Black #AfricanAmerican #PanAfrican #PanAfricanism #WEBDuBois #USHistory #AmericanHistory #PhD #Harvard #Massachusetts #Quotes #QuoteOfTheDay #Freedom #NAACP #Historian #Educator #Hero #Outspoken #BlackMen"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BhsFTCMAYcj/", "comments": [{"comment": "BENGHAZI", "author": "missihissifit"}, {"comment": "Spot on!😂", "author": "andria.vanb"}], "caption": "Spot-on analysis of this whole #Hannity-#Cohen thing...\n•\n😆😆😆\n•\nvia @johnfugelsang on Twitter\n•\n#Hannity #Cohen #Trump #StrangeBedfellows #SeanHannity #killerquotes #JohnFugelsang #resist #ThisIsNotNormal"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/Bm7W596lpx-/", "comments": [{"comment": "John was far from perfect.

Daily Kos is excited to endorse her in this race.\n**\nEscobar, a third-generation El Pasoan, directed a local nonprofit before beginning her career as a public servant, serving first as a county commissioner and later as El Paso County judge. From that perch, Escobar fought to increase transparency and accountability in county government, and she was instrumental in expanding local access to affordable health care.\n**\nEscobar is also a recognized expert on—and tenacious fighter for—immigrants’ rights and issues related to the U.S.-Mexico border, including trade. Last year, Escobar led judges and mayors across Texas as they denounced the state attorney general’s efforts to rescind DACA, and she took on the state’s new 'anti-sanctuary cities' law that would have forced local police to enforce federal immigration law. **\nA staunch progressive, Escobar is an advocate for a broad array of Democratic priorities.

In recent decades, various groups across North America have appealed to the team to renounce the logo, to no avail. But over the past year the commissioner of baseball, Rob Manfred, has pressured Paul Dolan, Cleveland’s chairman and chief executive, to make a change.\n*\nCiting a goal of diversity and inclusion, Manfred said that the Indians organization 'ultimately agreed with my position that the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use in Major League Baseball, and I appreciate Mr. Dolan’s acknowledgment that removing it from the on-field uniform by the start of the 2019 season is the right course.'\n*\nCleveland has been edging away from the logo in recent years and has used it less frequently, but beginning in 2019 it will not be seen on the team’s uniforms, or on banners and signs in the team’s stadium. Consumers will still be able to purchase items with the logo on them at the team’s souvenir shops in the stadium and at retail outlets.\" text via @nytimes\n\n#ChiefWahoo #Wahoo #Cleveland #Tribe #ClevelandIndians #RollTribe #DoTheRightThing #BlockC #ScriptI #PeopleNotMascots #NativeAmericans #Respect #YesItsRacist #GoodRiddance #MLB #Inclusion #Inclusivity #DoBetter #Baseball #Windians"}, {"key": "https://www.instagram.com/p/BgHdbDgnKs6/", "comments": [{"comment": "Women have been in the halls of power just by being working women with families for decades.
