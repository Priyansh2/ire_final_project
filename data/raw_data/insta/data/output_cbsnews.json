Biden said he's come clean with Melissa about his rocky past that includes his yearslong struggle with sobriety, getting kicked out of the Navy Reserve and dating his dead brother's wife. His ex-wife Kathleen Biden, whom he married in 1993, filed a motion in D.C. Superior Court on Feb. 23, 2017 seeking to freeze Biden's assets. She claimed in court documents that were leaked to the New York Post that Biden had put the family on the brink of financial ruin by spending massive amounts of money in strip clubs and on drugs, alcohol and prostitutes. It was in that motion that Kathleen dropped the bombshell that Hunter Biden was dating Hallie, his late brother's widow. For Biden, the consequences stemming from his business dealings with a Ukrainian gas company were on full display this week (10/18/2019). George Kent, a State Department official focused on Ukraine policy, told Congressional investigators that he had raised concerns in 2015 about Biden's role in Burisma Holdings, a gas company in Ukraine, but was turned away by a Joe Biden staffer and told that the then-vice president didn't have the \"bandwidth\" to deal with Hunter Biden's issues because his eldest son, Beau, was battling brain cancer. Kent testified in a closed-door hearing that he worried that Ukrainian officials would view Biden as a conduit for currying favor with his father but that the concerns had been brushed off."}, {"author": "think.hole", "comment": "Hit the call button in our bio and leave an anonymous message about anything.
