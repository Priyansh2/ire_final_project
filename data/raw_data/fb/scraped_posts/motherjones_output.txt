{"Post": "This summer, the Yurok Tribe declared rights of personhood for the Klamath River\u2014likely the first for a river in North America. A concept previously restricted to humans (and corporations), \u201crights of personhood\u201d means that an individual or entity has rights, and they\u2019re now being extended to nonhumans. With the declaration, the Yurok Tribe joins other Indigenous communities in a growing Rights of Nature movement aimed at protecting the environment. \u201cBy granting the rights of... personhood to the Klamath River, not only does it create laws and legal advocacy routes, but it\u2019s also an expression of Yurok values,\u201d says Geneva Thompson, associate general counsel for the tribe and citizen of the Cherokee Nation, who worked on the resolution. \u201cThe idea is that the laws of a nation are an expression of the nation\u2019s values.\u201d Legal personhood provides a different framework for dealing with problems like pollution, drought, and climate change. The crucial aspect to establishing these legal frameworks, Indigenous lawyers say, involves shifting relationships and codifying Indigenous knowledge\u2014recognizing nonhuman entities not as resources, but as rights holders. The Yurok resolution means that if the river is harmed, a case can be made in tribal court to remedy the problem. Currently, says Yurok Tribe General Counsel Amy Cordalis, laws like the Clean Water or Endangered Species acts can be used to protect rivers by addressing symptoms of problems like diseased fish or pollution. But the Yurok resolution seeks to address the river\u2019s problems directly and holistically, including the impacts of climate change. The resolutions give tribal nations new legal strategies for use in court, especially relating to climate change: \u201cThe idea of having legal avenues to address the harms of climate change is an important next step as legal systems adapt to the climate crisis,\u201d says Thompson. But it's not just happening here.

{"Post": "Trump's tweet about a civil war was just what the far-right Oath Keepers wanted to hear. In yet another presidential first, this week Donald Trump warned of an impending civil war in the United States\u2014via Twitter, of course. On Sunday night, Trump paraphrased Robert Jeffress, a preacher turned Fox News pundit, tweeting: \u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from... which our Country will never heal.\u201d The online reactions to the tweet were far-ranging. #CivilWar2 started trending. A Harvard law professor claimed the tweet itself was grounds for impeachment. A Republican representative disavowed the tweet as \u201cbeyond repugnant.\u201d Meanwhile, a right-wing militia group called the Oath Keepers weighed in to agree with Trump. The Oath Keepers describe themselves as an anti-government \u201cpatriot\u201d group whose members pledge to uphold the Constitution if a tyrannical president declares martial law. The group believes that day is imminent, and is constantly looking for evidence of a deep state conspiracy to back their ideology. As Mother Jones reported back in 2010, the group consists largely of soldiers, police, and veterans: \"In the belief that the government is already turning on its citizens, they are recruiting military buddies, stashing weapons, running drills, and outlining a plan of action. For years, they say, police and military have trained side by side in local anti-terrorism exercises around the nation.\" With Trump in the Oval Office, the group\u2019s long-standing antagonism toward the presidency appears to have waned.

{"Post": "Black workers are the heartbeat of the GM strike. The strike began September 16 after GM failed to reach an agreement with the United Auto Workers. In a general sense, the walkout is an effort by workers to reclaim some of the ground lost over the past dozen years. In 2009, GM received a $51 billion public bailout after filing for bankruptcy and in short order was flourishing again. Over the past three years the company has raked in $35 billion in North American profits. Its ...CEO, Mary Barra, has amassed a fortune, making more than $20 million in each of the previous two years, 281 times the median GM worker, the Detroit Free Press reports. And since the bailout, the company has paid almost nothing in federal taxes. In 2007, following a brief strike by 73,000 UAW members, a much-reviled tiered wage system was installed\u2014temp workers earn as little as $15 an hour at the start compared with the $30 an hour or so that so-called \u201clegacy\u201d workers make. The wage tiers have awakened the old, overlapping fault lines of race and class within the auto industry. While the demographic breakdown for GM isn\u2019t known, temporary workers across the American economy are disproportionately black and brown. Today, temps are completely at GM\u2019s mercy in countless other ways. As the Detroit Metro Times reports, they can\u2019t miss more than three pre-approved and unpaid days of work in a given year. they can be forced to work every day\u2014turning their weekend, a cherished labor victory, into a matter of company whim. But many hope to one day achieve full-time status, and so endure years of uncertainty and rickety economic prospects. We take you to the front lines of the UAW strike and talk to those leading it.

{"Post": "Fishers don't know how to stop hordes of hungry sea lions from stealing their catch, and now, their option seems to be illegally shooting them. West Coast fishers from California to Alaska use \"seal bombs\" to scare away seals and sea lions trying to steal their catch, including squid, anchovies, and salmon. These 3-inch explosives create a blast comparable to that of a small stick of dynamite, and once thrown overboard, the bombs detonate below the water\u2019s surface, producing ...a noise that can travel for over 40 miles underwater. But according to fishers, they're highly ineffective. Interviews with fishers and marine biologists and a review of studies reveal that seal bombs are unsuccessful at scaring sea lions away from fishing nets. And the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency in charge of handling nuisance sea lions, knows that seal bombs are ineffective. Yet the agency continues to enforce its policy against lethal deterrents, leaving fishers with few options other than to illegally kill sea lions or watch the animals gobble up their valuable catch. \u201cThis is our livelihood.

{"Post": "Humans unleash mountains of plastic into the sea each year, and that rate is only accelerating as plastic production grows around the world. The confounding bit is that scientists know little about where all that plastic is ending up\u2014in gyres like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, yes, but that\u2019s just a fraction of the debris released into the ocean each year. When plastic debris end up in the ocean, they break into smaller microplastics, often invisible to the human eye, that... swirl in the water column or sink to the bottom of the sea. Two recent studies have backed that up: One sampled water down thousands of feet in Monterey Bay and found particles, while the other took sediment samples off the coast of Southern California and found plastic in layers dating back to the 1940s, when its production began in earnest. But along the coast, you\u2019ll find plastic that\u2019s typically less than five years old. The science of ocean plastic pollution is so new, it\u2019s still hard to tell what\u2019s doing the most harm, and what most needs fixing. Macroplastics like single-use bags get into sea turtle stomachs, but microplastics are small enough to embed in organisms like shellfish. Along the coast, you\u2019ll find plastic that\u2019s typically less than five years old. The plastic they found out at sea, by contrast, is older and more weathered. \"The age and the look of plastic in coastal environments versus the plastic that we find in offshore waters is completely different,\u201d says Laurent Lebreton, chief scientist at Ocean Cleanup and lead author of a new paper in Nature Scientific Reports detailing the research.

{"Post": "From the moment Chanel Miller woke up in the hospital following her attack, her decision to pursue a criminal case against her rapist inflicted additional harm on her. Known first to the world as Emily Doe, Miller was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner on the Stanford University campus in January 2015. As details of the crime were reported\u2014two grad students on bikes had spotted Turner on top of the unconscious Miller behind a dumpster; when he ran, they chased him down\u2014she re...mained publicly anonymous. Driven in part by the knowledge that most sexual assault survivors never get a chance to hold their assailants accountable in court, Miller spent the next year cooperating with police and prosecutors, sticking with the criminal legal process, despite the pain, embarrassment, and retraumatization that came along with it. After intense media attention and a 16-day trial, a jury convicted Turner of three counts of felony sexual assault. Judge Aaron Persky sentenced Turner to six months in county jail, probation, and sex offender registration, rationalizing that anything tougher would have a \u201csevere impact\u201d on the Olympic swimming hopeful. Miller, then known only as Emily Doe, wrote a victim impact statement that went viral after it was published by BuzzFeed News. California changed its laws to impose mandatory prison sentences for sexual assault perpetrators whose victims are unconscious or intoxicated, and voters recalled Persky from the bench. Miller, now 27, tells the story of her life\u2014and her attempts to piece it back together\u2014following the now-notorious attack, in her new memoir, \"Know My Name.\" It begins with the evening before the fraternity party that preceded the assault and continues through Turner\u2019s sentencing and the years since, which saw the cultural changes of Donald Trump\u2019s election and the #MeToo movement. While Miller\u2019s victim impact statement sparked outrage about Turner\u2019s brief jail sentence and the deference he received as a white Stanford athlete, the outrage that builds over the course of her book is not directed at Turner, or even Persky, but at a justice system that requires victims to go through hell all over again.

Kate has been struggling to get an abortion in Mississippi, a state that  has attempted to place a severe gestational limit on abortion twice in recent years. The state mandates every patient undergo medically inaccurate counseling and be subjected to an ultrasound and a 24-hour waiting period, which means two separate trips to the clinic. Nearly half of Mississippians seeking abortion care travel out of state to get it, but even then, its neighbors in the Bible Belt aren\u2019t much better off.

As part of a delegation organized by Women\u2019s Earth and Climate Action Network (WECAN), a nonprofit group that engages women worldwide in environmental advocacy, they... walked the halls of Congress wearing formal Tlingit regalia instead of pantsuits and plain dresses. \u201cWe stood out that way,\u201d explains Culp, who is part of the Tlingit people. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be ignored.\u201d The nearly 17 million acres of the Tongass cover most of Southeast Alaska. Beyond the beauty of the Tongass and the forest\u2019s importance for native groups who hunt deer, gather berries, and catch salmon there, it\u2019s also one of the most significant carbon sinks in the world. According to Earthjustice, \u201cThe Tongass stores hundreds of millions, if not over a billion, tons of carbon, keeping the heat-trapping element out of the atmosphere.\u201d But now, new threats to the Tongass are imminent.

On the first day of a Warren administration, the Massachusetts Democrat promises to sign an executive order mandating a $15-an-hour minimum wage for federal contractors. She intends to eventually extend that minimum wage to all workers\u2014including tipped workers\u2014through federal legislation. The plan also calls for the passage of legislation that allows public sector workers, graduate students, gig-economy workers, farm workers, domestic workers, home care workers, and some managers to unionize.

Two years ago, after President Donald Trump infamously defended a white supremacist rally that brought violence to Charlottesville, Virginia, some law enforcement leaders sounded the alarm about a resurgent threat of far-right extremism.

A couple of cases included perpetrators who explicitly embraced Trump\u2019s nativist ideas and rhetoric. Since then, violence linked to far-right extremism has not only continued pace but has grown deadlier as the trend has converged with the mass shootings epidemic. According to Mother Jones research, there have been at least six gun rampages since last October marked by far-right ideology, including the mass murders at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas; a food festival in Gilroy, California; and a synagogue in Pittsburgh. What is clear is that the further rise of online radicalization and Trump\u2019s bitter politics of grievance have made for an increasingly explosive mix.

{"Post": "Robert Mueller helped paint a devastating picture of Trump, even if it took some coaxing. Mueller, whose reputation reached an almost mythical status amid his nearly two years of silence as special counsel, seemed notably human during roughly seven hours of testimony on Wednesday. He struggled to hear lawmakers\u2019 questions, stumbled at times over his words, and repeatedly ducked questions by referring back to his infamous report. But while Mueller may have disappointed as a pe...rformer, Democrats on the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees were surprisingly disciplined. And with an assist from some epically inept questioning by Republicans, the lawmakers led Mueller through a withering portrayal of President Donald Trump. Democrats used the hearing to highlight what Mueller said Trump and his cohorts clearly did do: seek to benefit from Russia\u2019s illegal actions, lie extensively about it, and then scramble to block investigations into those actions. Republicans...not so much. Republicans used their questions largely to pursue far-right hobbyhorses\u2014opposition research firm Fusion GPS remains a favorite\u2014and to attack Mueller for writing a report at all. But they barely bothered to challenge the basic outline of events that emerged in the two hearings. Mueller was, maybe inevitably, a disappointing witness\u2014far from the hail Mary many liberals had counted on. But in a way, it didn\u2019t matter that much. The hearings showed you can create a damning spectacle for this president by doing little more than saying out loud the things he did that we already know to be true.

The proposed rule change, announced by the Department of Agriculture, would limit the use of \u201cbroad based categorial eligibility\u201d\u2014a system, adopted by more than 40 states, that makes some low-income people automatically eligible for food stamps based on their receipt of other forms of federal aid, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). By undoing p...ortions of this automatic eligibility, the administration estimates it will save $2.5 billion by pulling food stamps from millions of recipients. Republicans have long lobbied to reduce food stamp expenditures by limiting categorical eligibility, which they see as wasteful and unfair, and attempted to pass a version of USDA\u2019s proposed change in last year\u2019s farm bill. Democrats, on the other hand, see this change as a threat to the health and security of millions of low-income families, by both narrowing food stamp eligibility while increasing paperwork families must complete to get food assistance. This proposed change is the latest in several other attempts by the Trump administration to curb food stamp access, including by imposing more severe work requirements and by changing the way the poverty threshold is calculated. mojo.ly/2Yyllmk (\ud83d\udcf8: Kevork Djansezian/Getty)", "Comments": {"Kristi Thrasher": {"text": "Dear rural areas, poor people that bought into his message that he's remembering you, the forgotten ones....

{"Post": "Alabama banned abortions. Then its lawmakers remembered that rapists can get parental rights. Each year, between 7,750 and 12,500 children are conceived from rape nationwide, according to Justice Department estimates. (Note: These numbers are likely low because many attacks are not reported.) Family custody lawyers say rapists sometimes push for parental rights to try to dissuade mothers from pressing for criminal charges, or after being asked to pay child support. Most state...s have laws on the books to allow courts to end or restrict rapists\u2019 parental rights under certain conditions. Alabama has long been an outlier: It\u2019s one of just two states (along with Minnesota) that has never passed such a law. In the past several weeks, after lawmakers in the state outlawed abortion even in cases of rape or incest, the issue has received renewed attention. mojo.ly/2IErJ5x (\ud83d\udcf8: Julien Mattia/Zuma)", "Comments": {"Laura Wells Pollick": {"text": "How kind of them to give this consideration.... now..."}, "Sara Smith": {"text": "How about we let women who have been raped create legislation that effects women who have been raped, because zero of the men who signed that into law understand that level of trauma."}}}
{"Post": "The \"Notorious\" RBG herself credits Brett Kavanaugh for making female law clerks the majority. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh squeaked through his confirmation hearing last year after being accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault during a high school party.

So it\u2019s no small irony that this year, th...anks solely to Kavanaugh, for the first time ever, the majority of Supreme Court law clerks are women. And perhaps it\u2019s also no small irony that on Friday, feminist icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg publicly gave Kavanaugh kudos for his hiring. mojo.ly/2wN16Gb (\ud83d\udcf8: Michael Brochstein/Zuma)", "Comments": {"Dianne Antonio": {"text": "I'll never forget the way he treated his wife during his \"crowning\".
