{"Post": "\u201cIn light of the discussion around Bob Baird\u2019s piece in this week\u2019s issue, The Hill News would like to provide some clarification. The Opinions section of the paper belongs to students and individuals who want to voice their opinion and be heard. That is an unalienable right that The Hill fully supports. This does not mean that any piece listed in Opinions reflects the sentiments of the paper itself. We understand that there are those who disagree strongly and are incensed by Baird\u2019s piece, and feel that they were misquoted and misrepresented. It is important to us that those who have an opinion or sentiment they would like to express either write to us in the form of a Letter to the Editor, sign up to be an Opinions writer themselves, or contact Bob directly. I am sure he will be more than willing to discuss your concerns.\u201d", "Comments": {}}
