{"Post": "I'm not quite sure why, but July 4th had become much more meaningful to me as a holiday the older I've gotten.

Maybe part of it is having kids myself, and having the chance to see the delight in their eyes as they watc...h fireworks, and walking through a small town parade with Kate and her family, waving flags and singing songs and enjoying everyone in their red, white and blue.  But I also think that in the same way, as you age, you come to appreciate the power of familial love more and more, as I've gotten older I've come to appreciate the same for love of country. You love your family because it's yours. Not because it's objectively the greatest family ever in history. Not because it's the greatest collection of humans who ever inhabited the planet.

{"Post": "Last night, in Kentucky, a state that's deep red in presidential elections, but had a popular Democratic Gov, elected a very conservative Republican governor. This surprised a lot of folks, partly because of polling that showed the Democratic candidate Jack Conway ahead, and partly because the Republican candidate Matt Bevin was last seen unsuccessfully primarying Mitch McConnell, and is very far right in his politics. But if you look at broader national trends under Obama, i...t's not so shocking. What we've seen is absolute decimation of local Democratic parties in red states in the Obama era. There are a lot of reasons for this, but the two principle ones seem to be: total inability of Ds to turn out voters in off year elections (KY turnout was 30%) AND the nationalization of every single election. Bevin ran ad after ad tying Conway to Obama and it worked. I joked last night on twitter that \"As the old saying goes, 'All politics is national.'\" And when we had Ryan Grim on he said something that's stuck with me, which is that presidential candidates in Iowa and New Hampshire are increasingly getting questions from voters not on local issues (where are you on Ethanol?) but on big national issues, because the media they consume is national media. And it made me wonder whether the absolute evisceration of local media outlets: particularly local news papers, state house coverage, municipal investigative reporters is a big factor in contributing to this nationalization of our politics. Curious what people think.", "Comments": {"David Rosenblatt": {"text": "Perhaps it's the inability or reluctance of voters to think for themselves, to investigate the issues independently and form their own opinion.
