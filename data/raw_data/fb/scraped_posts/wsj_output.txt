{"Post": "Ethel Meyer, 69, is one of an estimated one million Americans who have Parkinson's disease, and has hand tremors from the disease, which has no cure. But after taking up karate, Meyer says her twice-weekly sessions have boosted her balance and coordination. That aligns with a recent study showing that Parkinson\u2019s patients who did karate for one hour twice a week for 10 weeks performed better in several areas, including frequency of falls, quality of life and overall well-bein...g. \u201cAll exercise is a plus, but with karate and especially kata\u2014the drill sequence that is done on both sides of the body\u2014we are seeing the possibility of new neural pathways that help with balance and gait,\" said neurologist Jori Fleisher, the primary investigator of the study. The study was small and limited, but the level of engagement among participants was encouraging. Other exercises such as tai chi, boxing and dancing have previously been found to alleviate some symptoms and improve physical mobility. For Meyer, who also does cardio-spin and work with a personal trainer, karate gives her something she doesn\u2019t get from the other activities. \u201cI like the sense of achievement\u2026the competitiveness with yourself,\u201d she says, proudly pointing to her orange belt, the third-ranking up from beginner status. \u201cThe important thing is to keep at it, to not let your Parkinson\u2019s be an excuse,\u201d says Meyer. \u201cAnd to keep on exercising because it is the only thing you can control.\u201d Read more here: https://on.wsj.com/2VehVFi", "Comments": {"Ali Mahani": {"text": "cc Marie (unrelated to anything we chatted about recently), but interesting nonetheless."}, "Terry Komala": {"text": "Wow.."}}}
