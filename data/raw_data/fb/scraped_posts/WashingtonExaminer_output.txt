{"Post": "Democrats' calls for more gun control grow louder and louder, specifically for \"assault weapons\" - more accurately described as military style rifles. They cite a mass shooting \"epidemic\" threatening the lives of every American to bolster their position.  Mass shootings \u2013 defined by the FBI as 4 or more fatalities \u2013 are tragic, and heart-wrenching and often times become the impetus of calls for government to \"do something\" to help prevent them. This often leads to talks about... stronger gun control legislation or outright bans on rifles. The media, most of whom want to outlaw more guns, tend to tailor their reporting to bolster narratives rather than report these tragedies fairly.  Out of nearly 3 million deaths in the United States in 2017, there were 17,284 murders, comprising 0.6% of total deaths.  And out of those 17,284 murders, only 0.5% of them were a result of mass shootings. In 2017, the Las Vegas shooting became the deadliest mass shooting in the United States since 1949, yet mass shootings contributed to .5% of all murders. Heart disease remains the most prolific killer in the U.S.  Sources:  https://wonder.cdc.gov/\u2026/D76;jsessionid=AE46AE0BAFB136CD0A1\u2026 https://ucr.fbi.gov/\u2026/crime-in-the-u.s.-\u2026/topic-pages/murder https://www.fbi.gov/stats-servi\u2026/publications/serial-murder\u2026 https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/\u2026/dont-do-anything-about\u2026", "Comments": {"Alexis Kern": {"text": "The statistics are not the issue.

{"Post": "Many people are telling you that if you use plastic straws, then you\u2019re part of the problem when it comes to climate change, referencing the amount of plastic waste in the world\u2019s oceans. San Francisco, New York, and Washington, DC. have banned straws in an effort to limit plastic waste in the oceans. A question seldom asked let alone answered is what impact, if any, will this have on ocean pollution as a whole? The numbers show it will be negligible at best.  A study estimated that approximately 8.75 million metric tons (MMT) of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Out of that, the US contributes less than 0.9%. Of the US total, only .004% comes from plastic straws. That means that plastic straws from the US comprise only 0.00003% of the TOTAL plastic waste in the oceans. To get to the heart of why so much plastic is in the ocean, one must only look East. Asian countries make up the top contributors with 71.1% of the world's plastic ocean waste coming from them, of which China is the largest contributor. According to a 2015 study, the US only contributes an average of 80,000 metric tons of plastic ocean waste, of which only 3 metric tons are straws. NOTES: - Scientists estimate roughly 7.5 million straws lay on America\u2019s shorelines. At .4g each, that total equals 3 metric tons. http://bit.ly/30byHea - The 8.75 MMTs is the average of a range in a 2015 study of plastic in the ocean.
